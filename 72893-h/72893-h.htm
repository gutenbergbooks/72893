<span class="s8 tall-2">THE NEOPHYTE DROPS A CUP</span></h2>

<p>His great body stretched on the dirt floor in a
shady corner of the barracks-room of the
presidio, his long moustache drooped, his big
mouth open, Sergeant Carlos Cassara snored.</p>

<p>His face was purple from wine and the heat; for
the air was still and stagnant this siesta hour, and
empty vessels on the table near by told of the deep
drinking that had been done.</p>

<p>Scattered about were a corporal and a dozen soldiers,
all sleeping and snoring. Against the wall, half a score
of feet from the slumbering sergeant, an Indian
neophyte had dropped his palm-leaf and was glancing
around the room from beneath eyelids that seemed
about to close.</p>

<p>Outside was the red dust, a foot deep on the highway,
and the burning sun. The fountain before the mission
splashed lazily; down at the beach it seemed that the
tide had not its usual energy. Neophytes slept in the
shadows cast by the mission walls. Here and there a
robed fray went about his business despite the heat and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the hour. There was no human being travelling El
Camino Real—the king’s highway—as far as a man
with good eyes could see.</p>

<p>It was typical of the times—this siesta hour—with
the blue California sky above and the green Pacific
sparkling in the distance, and the spirit of present peace
over old Santa Barbara and its mission. Yet the peace,
being one of decadence and therefore uncertain, was
like to be broken at any time, as all men knew.</p>

<p>Gone were the days of the sainted Junipero Serra
and his coadjutors, who founded the mission chain
from San Diego de Alcalá to San Francisco de Asis
and made them strong in service to the natives and of
wealth in cattle and horses, olives, honey and wine,
tallow and hides.</p>

<p>Now the Mexican Republic held sway, with its
haughty governor riding up and down El Camino Real
in dignity; Indians—both gentiles and neophytes—were
sullen and enraged because of lands that had been
taken from them; officials sold concessions and robbed
right royally; and dissolute men created an atmosphere
that combatted that created by the frailes.</p>

<p>Robed Franciscans raised eyes to the skies and
prayed for an end of such unsubstantial, turbulent
times. And in this mingling of atmosphere Sergeant
Carlos Cassara slept, and his corporal and soldiers
slept, and the flies buzzed, and the neophyte servant
nodded against the wall.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed. The neophyte, whose duty it
was to wave the palm-leaf and keep flies and bees off
the face of the sergeant, swept the big fan through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
air languidly, glanced around to be sure that all slept,
then got slowly and silently to his feet.</p>

<p>Once more he waved the fan, then dropped it and
crept like a ghost across the room to the open door.
He stood in it for a moment, shading his eyes with
his hand, and looked up El Camino Real toward the
north. Sergeant Carlos Cassara continued his snoring,
but he opened one eye and watched the Indian closely.</p>

<p>Again the neophyte glanced back into the barracks-room,
and for that instant the sergeant’s eye was
closed. When it opened a second time the Indian was
contemplating the highway as before, and the manner
in which he stood expressed in itself hope and eagerness.</p>

<p>Presently he turned from the doorway to find that
the sergeant was sitting up on the floor and regarding
him. Mingled fear and rage flashed in the neophyte’s
eyes, then died out, and he hung his head and stood
waiting.</p>

<p>“Dog of a neophyte!” Cassara roared. “Is this the
way you attend to your duties? Wander away and
let your betters be eaten by flies, eh? Does not your
padre teach you to guard your superiors at all times?”</p>

<p>“Pardon, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“Pardon, coyote? ’Tis but a short distance from
the presidio to the mission proper, yet a bullet can find
your heart before you can reach the chapel and seek
sanctuary!”</p>

<p>The sergeant, grunting, got upon his feet, his eyes
never leaving those of the unfortunate neophyte, one
hand fumbling at the hilt of his sword, the other reaching
for a whip that hung on a peg in the adobe wall.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>“Come!” he commanded.</p>

<p>“Pardon, <i>señor</i>,” the neophyte whimpered again.</p>

<p>“A fly stung me while you lingered in the doorway.
’Tis proper that you, also, should be stung!”</p>

<p>“Pardon——”</p>

<p>“Have you no other word? <i>Dios!</i> Pardon—pardon—pardon!
Turn your back!”</p>

<p>“Par——”</p>

<p>“Say it not again, or by the good Saint Barbara, for
whom this post was named, I’ll have your hide off your
body in strips! Turn your back, dog!”</p>

<p>The whip sang through the air. Came a screech
from the neophyte even before the lash touched his
bare back! Corporal and soldiers sprang to their feet,
half terrified at the sudden din, reaching for their
weapons, trying to throw off their heavy sleep. Again
the lash, and again the screech! Across the shoulders
of the Indian two great welts showed. He dropped to
his knees; and the lash sang on, verse after verse of its
diabolical song, while the soldiers laughed and shouted
their approval—until Sergeant Carlos Cassara finally
hurled the whip to a far corner of the room and wiped
the perspiration from his brow with the back of his
hand.</p>

<p>“’Tis hot for such work, yet it must be done,” he
grunted. “Get up, hound! Hereafter do your duties
as you have been commanded. And now, tell me—what
were you doing at the door?”</p>

<p>“I thought I heard someone approach, <i>señor</i>. It was
but for an instant——”</p>

<p>“Do not talk so to me with your crooked tongue!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
Your padre should teach you truthfulness. As I snored
I kept an eye open to watch. You stood there minute
after minute, looking up El Camino Real. Whom do
you expect?”</p>

<p>“If the <i>señor</i> will par——”</p>

<p>“Do not say it again! For whom were you
looking?”</p>

<p>“I have a brother at San Francisco de Asis, <i>señor</i>.
He has been helping the good padre there. He is due
to return——”</p>

<p>“And you so love your brother that you would run to
meet him, eh?” the sergeant interrupted. “Straighten
your tongue, dog, and answer me my question!”</p>

<p>“I swear that I have a brother coming, <i>señor</i>!”</p>

<p>“Um! If you swear, I suppose that it must be so.
At least the padre teaches you to respect an oath. But
was it your brother for whom you were looking?
Answer me that!”</p>

<p>“I am anxious to greet him, <i>señor</i>. He has been a
long time in the north.”</p>

<p>“No doubt. Take your bruised back to the other
room, now, and fetch wine. And if you wish to live
to greet your brother, be sure that you fetch it quickly!”</p>

<p>The neophyte glided away as the soldiers laughed.
Sergeant Cassara stalked to the table in the middle of
the room, and the others crowded around him when
he beckoned.</p>

<p>“This neophyte will bear watching,” the sergeant
announced. “I have suspected him for several days.
He has a sneaking way about him, the dog! He would
like to slit our throats as we sleep, no doubt!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“It is true that he has a brother coming from San
Francisco de Asis,” the corporal offered. “I heard him
speaking of it yesterday to a fray.”</p>

<p>“That part of it may be true. Each of the hounds
has a score of brothers. ’Tis the man’s great anxiety
to greet this brother of his that arouses my curiosity.
Seldom does an Indian betray such family devotion.
With seditious messages going and coming up and
down the highway——”</p>

<p>“But our orders are merely to be watchful of all
strangers,” the corporal put in.</p>

<p>“Strangers! How long has it been since a genuine
stranger of any quality drifted along El Camino Real?
Answer me that! Strangers, eh? Watch the padres
and the neophytes, say I! There is little love lost
between the presidio and the chapel! At the same
time——”</p>

<p>The sergeant stopped speaking, for the Indian had
come into the room again, carrying a jug of wine. His
head was bent forward on his breast, and he walked
like a man suffering pain. There was silence as he
filled the drinking cups; he stood to one side as the
soldiers drank. Again he made the round of the table
and filled the cups, then put the jug down and hurried
out.</p>

<p>“If the man’s brother comes, it will be well to
investigate him before he reaches the chapel and has
a talk with the padre,” continued the sergeant. “A
curse on this land of sun and dust and flies! ’Tis a
dog’s life—’tis an old man’s life, worse! There was
a time when neophytes joined with gentiles and gave us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
fight. Those were the good days—half a score of us,
perhaps, against a hundred of the red wretches!”</p>

<p>“If rumour proves true, those good days may come
again soon,” the corporal remarked.</p>

<p>“Glad would I be to welcome them! A man’s blade
grows rusty and his sword-arm heavy with fat. Who
can put heart in shooting when it is only to shoot at a
mark? I am half minded to keep to myself anything
I may discover. Let them form their conspiracy, say
I! It will give soldiers good work to do!”</p>

<p>He put his empty cup on the table and walked across
the room; the others sank back on their stools again.
Sergeant Cassara stood in the open doorway looking
toward the mission and watching a flock of sheep, just
down from their grazing-place in the hills. The heat
waves danced before his half-closed eyes. Corporal
and soldiers began nodding again over their cups.</p>

<p>Then Cassara turned and glanced toward the north.
Far down the highway was a swirl of dust. Cassara
shaded his eyes with his cupped hands and gazed in that
direction. The soldiers heard him utter an exclamation,
saw him straighten suddenly and express interest.</p>

<p>“By the good Saint Barbara!” he exclaimed. “A
stranger comes at last!”</p>

<p>Corporal and soldiers dropped their wine cups and
hurried across the room. They looked where their
sergeant pointed. Down El Camino Real, kicking up
great clouds of red dust, came a man. No fray or
neophyte, this, nor a native runner on business connected
with the missions! Here was a gay caballero<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
clad in zarape and sombrero, who staggered as he
walked and carried a burden on his back.</p>

<p>“Is the world coming to an end, that gentlemen of
quality walk the highway and pack their belongings?”
the sergeant cried.</p>

<p>“’Tis a saddle he bears,” the corporal added. “I can
see the sun flashing from the silver on it. This is a
peculiar thing. Perhaps he has met with disaster, is
wounded and we should give him aid.”</p>

<p>“I suppose, according to orders, some of us should
go out in this devil’s blaze and accost him,” the sergeant
returned. “A caballero who walks the highway and
packs his saddle surely is a suspicious personage. However,
we’ll wait for a time. If he is wounded, he
cannot escape—and he must pass the presidio. Send a
man to awaken the ensign, corporal. ’Tis rare to
think we have legitimate excuse for waking him—he
loves his sleep too well, that pretty officer of ours!”</p>

<p>“Your caballero is coming here!” the corporal
announced.</p>

<p>“So he is! He turns off the main highway! A
gentlemanly caballero, at least, to save us a journey out
in the sun. Mind your manners, now! Do not make
him suspicious. Do you attend to your own business,
all of you, and allow me to do the talking. But awaken
the ensign, just the same!”</p>

<p>The neophyte had entered the barracks-room again
and was refilling the wine cups, and from the cupboard
he carried a fresh one to the table for the approaching
stranger. His lips were set tightly over his teeth
because of the pain the lashing had caused, but his eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
were flashing with something besides anger. Sergeant
Cassara turned quickly and observed the Indian’s
manner.</p>

<p>“Um!” the sergeant grunted. “A man finds himself
torn between a desire to do his duty and a desire to let
things take their course and enjoy the fighting that
surely will follow. Neophyte! Get you some food
ready! From the manner in which this man staggers
through the dust, he comes to us with an empty belly.”</p>

<p>Again the Indian hurried to the rear room. The
soldiers crowded around the doorway in the shade.
The stranger was within fifty yards of them now.
They saw that he stooped beneath the weight of the
heavy saddle, and that a bridle heavily chased with
silver hung over one of his arms. A sword swung at
his side; a pistol was at his hip. His clothing was
covered with red dust, but they could see that it was
rich. His sombrero clung to one side of his head, as
if about to fall off. His hair was dark and hung in
clusters of curls.</p>

<p>“’Tis a pretty young gentleman!” Sergeant Cassara
snorted. “Now we shall hear a tearful tale of the
highway, I suppose, of how some five thousand bandits
set upon him and how he slew half and frightened the
remainder so that they fled, making his escape and
bringing away loot! Saint Barbara, forgive me if I
think for an instant that such a beau-looking being
could be a conspirator!”</p>

<p>Once the stranger staggered, hesitated a moment,
then came on. Not until he was inside the shadow cast
by the presidio building did he stop. There he threw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
his saddle and bridle upon the ground, stamped his
boots, slapped at his clothes to shake off a part of the
accumulated dust, wiped his brow with a scented silk
handkerchief, and stood erect. Across his face flashed
a rare smile.</p>

<p>“This cordial reception overwhelms me,” he said,
speaking in deep tones. “I have received hospitality at
several places along El Camino Real, yet always will I
remember the greetings extended at Santa Barbara. I
shall live to tell my grandchildren how the soldiers,
seeing me from afar, ran to my assistance, insisting
that they carry my saddle and bridle, clean my boots
and my clothes and offer me refreshing wine and food,
how a neophyte held damp palm-fronds over my head
and fanned away the heat, how guitar music was played
as I ate and drank, and how the mission bells rang in
my honour. Never will I forget the kindnesses you
have exhibited. If ever it is within my poor power to
repay, at least in part——”</p>

<p>“’Tis His Excellency the Governor!” exclaimed Sergeant
Cassara, in mock horror.</p>

<p>“It might have been—and then how would you have
felt? Even his excellency might meet with disaster on
the highway!”</p>

<p>“Now comes the tale of the five thousand bandits,”
said the sergeant to his soldiers. Turning to the
stranger, he added: “Is it now the fashion for a
caballero to tramp the dusty trail like an Indian from
a rancheria?”</p>

<p>“All strong men do it for the pure love of exercise,”
was the reply. “The best of us carry a weight. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
saddle of mine, for instance, is no light thing. I am
glad you ran to aid me this last half mile.”</p>

<p>“’Tis an unpleasant day,” murmured the sergeant,
half ashamed.</p>

<p>“Ten miles afoot through dust and sun have proved
it so to me.”</p>

<p>“Half a score of miles, say you? Are you walking
on a wager, for instance? Perhaps it is a penance
imposed by your padre. Enter, at least, and partake of
food and wine.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Once more the unbounded hospitality of
Santa Barbara’s presidio!” the new-comer gasped. “I
accept with delight, hail wine and food with joy!”</p>

<p>He picked up his saddle and bridle and entered, to
throw them on the floor in a corner of the room.
Already the neophyte had filled the wine cups and put
out cold food. The stranger bowed and sat at the head
of the table.</p>

<p>“I trust that you will excuse my lack of conversation
for the time being,” he said. “Ten miles such as I
have had to-day give a man hunger and thirst.”</p>

<p>“More food, neophyte!” the sergeant roared. “We
have before us a famished man. Water, that he may
bathe his face and hands after he has eaten. Brush his
cloak, also, and clean his boots. The hospitality of the
Santa Barbara presidio is questioned, I believe. By
the good saint, we will treat him as well as any fray or
padre at any mission in the chain!”</p>

<p>“I toast you, fair sir!” exclaimed the stranger, and
emptied the wine cup. The eager neophyte filled it
again quickly and departed for water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>“When we observed you in the distance,” the sergeant
said, “I sent a man to awaken our ensign. Being an
officer who loves his sleep, it probably will be some
minutes before he arrives to greet you. If, in the meantime,
you care to relate what has befallen you on the
highway we shall rejoice to hear it.”</p>

<p>“A matter of small consequence,” replied the
stranger. “I was set upon by bandits, both Indian and
Mexican.”</p>

<p>“One of each?” inquired the sergeant, blandly.</p>

<p>“At least half a score of each, <i>señor</i>—quite a company,
in fact.”</p>

<p>“Ah! Now we are to get the story of your prowess.
Kindly proceed, caballero!”</p>

<p>“I rode alone, save for an Indian. We were ambushed.
My Indian fell at the first discharge of
arrows——”</p>

<p>“Arrows, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“At first—so as to make no noise and put other
travellers on their guard, I presume. Then the bandits
rushed. Standing with my back against a jumble of
rocks, I emptied my two pistols in their faces. Then
I drew my sword. Arrows and bullets were flying
about me then, yet in my anger I made such good use
of my blade that the bandits fled—those able to flee.
They had slain my horse and my Indian’s mule. I took
off saddle and bridle, not wishing to leave them behind
for the thieves, and trudged here afoot, some half-score
of miles, carrying my property. That is all—it
is of small consequence.”</p>

<p>“An excellent tale!” Sergeant Cassara cried, slapping<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
his thigh. “You are a man after my own heart,
caballero! Neophyte, fill the man’s wine cup again!
And now, fair sir, that you have repaid us for your
refreshment with this artful bit of fiction, will you
not indeed be kind enough to tell us what happened to
your mount that sent you walking along El Camino
Real carrying your saddle?”</p>

<p>“Is it possible,” demanded the stranger, “that you do
not believe my story?”</p>

<p>“Was I born during the last moon, think you? Have
I cut my first tooth? Can I, by any chance, yet stand
without clinging to the wall—what?”</p>

<p>Sergeant Cassara roared with laughter, throwing
back his head and opening his wide jaws. The corporal
and soldiers joined in the merriment. And as suddenly
as the laughter had commenced it died out, for the
stranger had risen slowly and deliberately and was
wiping his greasy hands on the end of his cloak. His
eyes had narrowed until it seemed that flashes of fire
came from between the lids; his hands gripped the
edge of the table as he bent forward.</p>

<p>“This has been a hard day for me, <i>señor</i>,” he said.
“I am not used to walking great distances in the dust
and sun and carrying a heavy weight while doing so.
Indeed, I am far from feeling fresh. But, by all the
saints that ever existed or will, I still have strength
enough to run through the man who calls me liar!
Draw, you—and on guard!”</p>

<p>“Though you have slain half the bandits on the
coast, you still thirst for blood?” laughed the sergeant.</p>

<p>“This is not levity, <i>señor</i>. You have questioned my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
word. Draw and defend yourself—else be called
coward!”</p>

<p>A roar like that of an angry bull came from the
throat of Sergeant Cassara, and the stool upon which
he had been sitting was kicked to one corner of the room
as he sprang to his feet. His blade was out in an
instant, his eyes flashed with anger, his face was purple
with rage, and he stood ready in the centre of the
room beside the table with curses rumbling in his
throat. The other soldiers had dashed to the wall out
of the way; the neophyte had come in at the doorway,
and now crouched there, watching.</p>

<p>With deliberation the stranger just off the highway
drew his blade and stepped forward to engage. There
was no haste in his manner, no nervousness apparent.
He went about this business of duelling as calmly as
he would have drawn on a pair of boots.</p>

<p>The steel clashed, and the two men circled around
the room, the sergeant breathing heavily, the other
fencing without apparent effort. Yet the sergeant could
have told that, by the feel of the blade, he was aware
of the strength in the other’s wrist, and knew he was
fighting with no weakling. Every trick he tried was
met by a better one; the stranger had a guard for every
thrust. The soldiers against the wall began to murmur
with delight—here was fencing to be seen!</p>

<p>And then the sergeant let out a bellow as a favourite
thrust was turned aside, and losing his head started to
force the fighting. He thrust and slashed, while the
stranger’s blade darted in and out like the tongue of a
serpent. Step by step, the man off the highway was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
forced to retreat, yet those who watched beside the
wall realised he was but awaiting the proper time. In
the hearts of the corporal and his soldiers there was
sudden fear for the big sergeant with whom they had
served for so long. In the heart of the neophyte who
crouched at the door there was a sudden hope.</p>

<p>Then came an exclamation from the corporal, who
was watching closely! The stranger’s blade made a
sudden dart forward; the sergeant’s sword described
an arc through the air, the sun flashed from it an instant,
then it crashed against the wall and its owner stood disarmed.
The caballero stepped back and bowed.</p>

<p>“Even so, <i>señor</i>!” he said. “If you will regain your
blade, I’ll be glad to teach you another lesson. You are
not without skill, yet your arm appears slow from too
much leisure.”</p>

<p>“Now, by the good saint——!” Cassara began. But
he broke off his sentence in the middle, for he had
glanced toward the doorway, and in it stood the ensign.</p>

<p>The caballero turned, removed his sombrero, and
made a sweeping bow. His eyes were twinkling again.</p>

<p>“What brawl is this?” the ensign demanded.</p>

<p>“A little question regarding my veracity, <i>señor</i>,” the
caballero replied. “If it is your wish to see it
settled——”</p>

<p>“Enough! Sergeant, pick up your sword, and hereafter
do not brawl with strangers—at least not until I
have conversed with them. And you, <i>señor</i>, be kind
enough to be seated, and tell me your name and station
and why you travel El Camino Real. You came from
the north?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Si, señor</i>—from San Francisco de Asis.”</p>

<p>“And you are going——?”</p>

<p>“To San Diego de Alcalá.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a long, dusty journey at this time of the year.
Your business is——?”</p>

<p>“Mine own, <i>señor</i>, and it please you!”</p>

<p>“Have a care! I do not question you through impertinence,
but through a sense of duty.”</p>

<p>“My business is of no particular consequence in so
far as you are concerned, <i>señor</i>. I have here a pass
signed by his excellency that perhaps will quiet your
fears.”</p>

<p>He took a folded document from his cloak and
handed it over. The ensign, frowning, took it and
spread it open. He read it through, then looked at
the caballero again.</p>

<p>“It is, in truth, his excellency’s signature and seal,
and tells all officers the bearer is to be allowed to proceed
unmolested and given aid if he asks it,” the ensign
admitted. “Yet the pass does not name you, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“I am aware that it does not.”</p>

<p>“I am Ensign Sanchez, <i>señor</i>. May I have the
pleasure of knowing you?”</p>

<p>“Man to man, I am glad to make your acquaintance.
As for the name—does it matter? You may call me
Felipe, or Juan—whatever pleases you.”</p>

<p>“It is highly irregular.”</p>

<p>“Is the pass irregular, <i>señor</i>? You know the times,
I take it. Can you conceive a reason why a gentleman
might not wish his name cried aloud for all men to
hear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span></p>

<p>“Ah! If you are on business of his excellency’s——”</p>

<p>“Let us have no misunderstanding or false pretense,
<i>señor</i>. I have not said that I am on business of state. I
have said merely that I hold his excellency’s pass, and
that you are bound to honour it.”</p>

<p>The ensign rose and bowed; and he was smiling.</p>

<p>“So be it!” he replied. “I am glad to welcome you
to Santa Barbara. Your business, I perceive, is indeed
your own. Command me, if there is anything you
desire.”</p>

<p>“Your men have given me food and drink, <i>señor</i>,
thank you and them. I was forced to walk into the post
because of an attack of bandits——”</p>

<p>“How is this?”</p>

<p>“My Indian was slain, also my horse. I managed
to drive off the thieves and reach here afoot. I wish to
continue my journey immediately. So my only request,
<i>señor</i>, will be for a good horse, for which I stand ready
to pay.”</p>

<p>Ensign Sanchez threw up his hands in a gesture of
despair.</p>

<p>“Ask me for a fortune, <i>señor</i>; ask me to turn traitor
to his excellency! Either would be forthcoming sooner
than a good horse at this moment. Not a horse worthy
of the name can you find now at Santa Barbara. In a
day, say, or two, by sending out to some rancho, I may
be able to get you one, but none are here now except
decrepit brutes I would not ask a gentleman to mount.”</p>

<p>“This is almost past belief!” the caballero said.</p>

<p>“First came the Indian outbreak a year ago, when all
the good animals were either killed or run off, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
recently came a requisition from his excellency. We
have good horses coming, <i>señor</i>, from San Juan Capistrano
in exchange for other commodities, but they will
not arrive for another month. Believe me, <i>señor</i>, I am
sorry! If your business is urgent——”</p>

<p>“I must depart within an hour, and I must have a
mount of some kind—the best to be obtained.”</p>

<p>“Ask for food, or gold, or a score of Indian guides!
But when it comes to a good horse——”</p>

<p>There was a sudden commotion at the door, where
the soldiers had been standing, jesting with the sergeant
over his recent defeat. To the ears of the ensign
and his guest came the sound of tinkling bells, and they
heard the loud laughter of the troopers.</p>

<p>“By the good saint—another stranger!” Cassara exclaimed.
“Are all the grandees of Spain abroad this
day?”</p>

<p>The ensign and the caballero arose and walked across
to the door. Down El Camino Real they saw
approaching a man astride a mule. He was richly
dressed. The mule had a string of bells around its neck.
The rider wore pistol and sword, and he held a guitar
under one arm. He waved at the men crowded about
the doorway, then struck the strings of the instrument
and began to sing.</p>

<p>“There comes your mount, <i>señor</i>,” the ensign said,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Very true!” the caballero replied; and there was no
merriment in his face as he said it.</p>

<p>He folded his arms and stood beside the ensign in
the doorway, waiting. The song of the latest arrival<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
reached an end as the mule came to a stop before them.
The rider swung his guitar behind his back, dismounted,
removed his sombrero and bowed to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Greetings!” he called. “I crave hospitality, food
and drink for both myself and beast, refreshment after
my long and dusty journey and my bad fright.”</p>

<p>“Fright?” questioned the ensign.</p>

<p>“Even so, <i>señor</i>. A distance of ten miles from here
I rounded a curve in the highway to come upon dead
men, a dead mule and a dead horse. It must have
been a pretty battle there! I haven’t seen as much
blood in a score of moons. Indians and Mexicans—filthy
bandits, I took them to be! I counted six, then
covered my eyes with my hands and fled. Blood always
did upset me. But it must have been a rare battle!”</p>

<p>Sergeant Carlos Cassara looked back at the caballero
with wide and glistening eyes, his anger at his recent
defeat somewhat assuaged.</p>

<p>“By the good saint!” he swore. “My gentlemanly
pedestrian of the highway must have been telling me
the truth.”</p>

<p>He called a neophyte servant to take the mule to
the adobe stable in the rear of the barracks, while the
new-comer followed the ensign inside, followed in turn
by the sergeant and the soldiers.</p>

<p>“You command here?” the mule’s owner asked
the ensign.</p>

<p>“At present. My lieutenant is visiting at a rancho
near by.”</p>

<p>“And you are called——?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>“Ensign Sanchez, <i>señor</i>. May I ask your name in
turn?”</p>

<p>“It really does not matter. Allow me, <i>señor</i>, to
present you a pass signed by His Excellency the Governor.
You will find, I think, that he tells all officers
to use me with respect and to aid me on my way. Look
not for my name, there, <i>señor</i>, for you will not find it.”</p>

<p>“It is almost beyond belief,” the ensign said, “that
two strangers should arrive in a single day, each with
a pass from his excellency that is innocent of a name.”</p>

<p>“How is this? Another stranger with a pass?”</p>

<p>“This gentleman you see before you, <i>señor</i>. It was
he, I believe, who slew those men you stumbled over
in the highway.”</p>

<p>“Then he is an excellent shot and has a good sword-arm!”
He turned and looked the caballero straight in
the eyes, and the ensign watched to see if a sign passed
between them, but could not observe any. “After all,”
he resumed, “suppose we both do have passes—what
of it? His excellency trusts more than one man in this
broad world, I assume. But, since there are two of us
without names, we are going to have difficulty carrying
on polite conversation. It is better we called ourselves
something before we get badly tangled. You may call
me Juan, for instance.”</p>

<p>“And you may call me Claudio,” said the caballero,
laughing.</p>

<p>“Excellent! Juan and Claudio!”</p>

<p>“Devil and Hades!” growled Sergeant Cassara.
“’Tis enough to give a man a crooked brain! Neophyte!
Get food and drink for the <i>señor</i>!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span></p>

<p>The mule’s owner sat at one end of the table, the
caballero at the other end, with the ensign between
them. The former ate; the two latter drank. The
neophyte hung about, seemingly anxious to be of service
to these two fine gentlemen, always watching their faces
like a man who expects a message. Sergeant Cassara
gathered his squad and stalked to the end of the
barracks-room like an old hen clucking to her chickens,
and got out cards and dice.</p>

<p>“You came from San Francisco de Asis?” queried
the ensign of the mule’s owner.</p>

<p>“I left there recently.”</p>

<p>“We are to have the pleasure of your company at
Santa Barbara for some time?”</p>

<p>“For an hour or two while I rest, <i>señor</i>. I am on
my way to San Diego de Alcalá.”</p>

<p>“This other guest of mine, at present known as
Claudio, also goes to San Diego de Alcalá.”</p>

<p>“So? I shall be glad to avail myself of his companionship
on the highway, if he is willing, since he
has so strong an arm and such courage. So much
blood I never saw in one small spot——!”</p>

<p>“But there are difficulties,” the ensign continued.
“The <i>señor</i> lost his mount during the attack of the
bandits, and we have no good horse we can furnish him.
It will take a day or two to send out to some rancho
for a worthy steed, but he would proceed on his way
almost immediately.”</p>

<p>“It desolates me to hear it, for I would have liked
this stranger’s company on the journey. But it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
imperative that I follow the highway again within
an hour or so.”</p>

<p>“I find myself in the same predicament,” the
caballero announced.</p>

<p>“It is sad, <i>señor</i>, yet it is true, that we both cannot
ride one mule with any degree of speed and comfort.”</p>

<p>“Agreed! Yet, I think, if you are a gentleman of
spirit, I will ride south on your mule, and you will wait
here a day or two until a horse can be fetched from a
rancho.”</p>

<p>“That is a broad statement, <i>señor</i>,” replied the mule’s
owner, his face growing dark for an instant.</p>

<p>“I did not mean it in a disrespectful way.”</p>

<p>“You imagine, perhaps, that you are on business
of state and that I will surrender my mule because of
that? Ordinarily, <i>señor</i>, but not at this time. I have
important business at San Diego de Alcalá.”</p>

<p>“And I! If you are wiling to let merit decide
between us——”</p>

<p>“Fight you for my own mule? After what I
observed in the highway? Give me credit for some
wit, kind <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“It will not be necessary to clash blades over a mule.”
The caballero bent forward over the table as he spoke,
and his eyes held those of the other man. “There are
other ways—dice, for instance, or cards!”</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and then the owner
of the mule threw himself backward in a gale of loud
laughter, and the soldiers in the corner looked up in
astonishment.</p>

<p>“Dice? Cards?” he cried. “You would play me for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
my own mule? It is amusing! And what would I
stand to win, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“What you will—money, such jewels as I have on my
person——”</p>

<p>“A note of promise to pay, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“Not so, <i>señor</i>, since to give you that I would of a
necessity be obliged to disclose my name.”</p>

<p>“I understand. It appears that there are two of us
not anxious to disclose names. Did we not have passes
from his excellency, we might have trouble with our
friend the ensign here. You would play me—stake
gold and jewels against my poor mule, eh? My journey
is urgent, <i>señor</i>, but never have I refused to play.”</p>

<p>“Then you agree?”</p>

<p>“I do <i>señor</i>, except that you wait for half an hour.
I never throw dice or flip a card while exhausted. In
the meantime we can converse. It would avail me
nothing, I suppose, to ask your business at San Diego
de Alcalá?”</p>

<p>“No more than for me to ask yours, <i>señor</i>,” replied
the caballero, smiling.</p>

<p>The mule’s owner sipped at his wine.</p>

<p>“Quite so!” he said, thoughtfully. “Then let us
talk of affairs at the other end of El Camino Real. I
understand that his excellency is coming along the
highway soon.”</p>

<p>The ensign sat up straight on his stool, all attention,
and regarded the speaker closely. The neophyte’s eyes
narrowed an instant, and he drew nearer the table,
pretending to be of service, listening intently at every
word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>“His excellency coming? This is news!” the ensign
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I heard it rumoured before I left San Francisco
de Asis. A tour of inspection, I believe. Ha! Perhaps,
officer, you can solve me that riddle? ’Tis said
he makes the journey within a month. A tour of
inspection, eh? With a couple of hundred soldiers at
his heels?”</p>

<p>The neophyte dropped a wine cup.</p>

<p>“Clumsy idiot!” the ensign growled.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II"><span class="tall-2">CHAPTER II<br></span>

<span class="s8">ALONG THE HIGHWAY</span></h2>

<p>The table was cleared save for three fresh cups
newly filled by the Indian, one at the elbow of
each man. Sergeant Cassara lurched across the
room pulling at his belt, and the corporal and
soldiers followed at a respectful distance, and slowly,
trying not to show so much interest in the proceeding
that there would be a rebuke from the ensign.</p>

<p>The mule’s owner was chuckling to himself; the
caballero sat at the other end of the table grim and
determined.</p>

<p>“I do not pretend to interest myself too much in the
business of either of you gentlemen,” the ensign announced,
“yet it seems to me a day or two at Santa
Barbara would not be amiss. Within two days I can
get an excellent horse and you two may take the remainder
of your journey together.”</p>

<p>“I must depart at the earliest possible moment,” the
caballero replied.</p>

<p>“And I also,” said the owner of the mule.</p>

<p>“You are determined to play?” queried the ensign.
“Then one, I suppose, will depart as soon as the game
is over, and the other remain here until I can procure
a good steed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span></p>

<p>“That is the situation,” his guests agreed.</p>

<p>“Riding the mule, you scarcely can reach another
mission by fall of night.”</p>

<p>“If I am successful in leaving on the mule, I’ll not
stop until I reach the pueblo at Reina de Los Angeles,”
the caballero said. “I’ll get food and drink where
and how I can. My business is urgent.”</p>

<p>“There may be more bandits.”</p>

<p>“There are more bullets in my pistols and more
thrusts in my sword-arm, <i>señor</i>. I dislike to appear
a boaster, but I am inclined to believe I can care for
myself.”</p>

<p>He met the eyes of the mule’s owner, as if there was
some special significance in the words, and for the
moment the chuckling of the latter stopped.</p>

<p>“And you, <i>señor</i>?” asked the ensign, turning toward
the other end of the table.</p>

<p>“My plans are similar to those of the caballero,
officer. Let us play.”</p>

<p>He began chuckling again; he seemed to be enjoying
a rare joke that the others did not know. Very carefully
he turned back the lace of his cuffs and pulled
the sleeves of his jacket a few inches up his arms. His
long, tapering fingers worked for a moment, then he
clasped his hands and waited. The caballero turned
back his cuffs also, and put his hands on the table before
him. He never took his eyes from the other man; he
was as calm, apparently, as when duelling with the
sergeant.</p>

<p>“Well?” the ensign asked. “What is the game?
What are the stakes to be?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span></p>

<p>“Whatever the <i>señor</i> considers the value of his
mule,” the caballero said.</p>

<p>“It seems that mules have risen in demand, and so
in value, yet I will do the fair thing. I stake the
beast, saddle and bridle, even my guitar, also the chance
to be the one to proceed along the highway immediately.
And do you, <i>señor</i>, put out your gold, piece by piece,
until I have cried enough.”</p>

<p>“It is a fair plan,” the caballero said. He took a
purse from his bosom, opened the mouth of it, and
began taking out gold coins, piece by piece, piling
them before him on the table, while the mule’s owner
counted under his breath and the ensign pretended not
to be interested, and the sergeant and the soldiers bent
forward, their eyes bulging. Bit by bit the pile of gold
grew, yet the caballero did not hesitate, and the tenth
piece was placed on the table as quickly as the first.</p>

<p>“Hold!” called the mule’s owner, presently. “It
is agreeable, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“I am satisfied. As you say, mules have risen in
demand and price.”</p>

<p>“Then we play!” He reached to his belt, and drew a
pack of cards from behind it and tossed them on the
table. He took dice forth, and placed them beside the
cards.</p>

<p>“Your choice, <i>señor</i>?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Let it be cards,” the caballero answered.</p>

<p>“Ah! Cards it is!” He picked up the dice and
returned them to his pocket, and then reached for the
pack, and his long fingers shuffled the bits of pasteboard
with a skill born of experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span></p>

<p>“But not that pack of cards, <i>señor</i>!” There was
a certain ring in the caballero’s voice that caused the
ensign to glance at him sharply and made the mule’s
owner flush. The smile left the latter’s face and his
chuckling ceased again.</p>

<p>“You have objections to this particular pack of
cards?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I have indeed, <i>señor</i>. This is to be a game of
chance, not one of skill.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean by that, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“We are playing for high stakes, perhaps—possibly
for more than a mule and guitar. Suppose we use
some deck of cards procured by our good friend, the
sergeant. There will be no question then of—er—undue
familiarity with a certain pack.”</p>

<p>“You mean to insinuate, <i>señor</i>, that I would cheat
at cards?”</p>

<p>“Would you use my private deck, <i>señor</i>, had I one
with me?”</p>

<p>“Possibly not.”</p>

<p>“You see? Let us use the sergeant’s cards. I
assure you that I have not touched one of them.”</p>

<p>“So be it!” The mule’s owner shrugged his
shoulders. His teeth did not flash in a smile again.
His fists were clenched until the knuckles were white.</p>

<p>Sergeant Cassara fetched the cards and threw them
on the table, then stood back.</p>

<p>“We will allow the ensign to shuffle them and place
them before us,” the caballero said. “Each of us
will then draw a card. The one who draws the highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
will ride away on the mule and take this heap of gold
with him. Is anything simpler?”</p>

<p>“As you say, it is very simple.”</p>

<p>“And you are agreed?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>Ensign Sanchez drew a deep breath and shuffled the
cards. He put the pack in the middle of the table
and looked at his two guests.</p>

<p>“Draw first, <i>señor</i>,” the caballero offered.</p>

<p>“Suppose we cut the pack in the middle and discard
the top,” said the other. “It is best to be careful.”</p>

<p>“You dare to insinuate—” began the ensign, starting
to get up from his stool.</p>

<p>“Softly, softly, officer. I insinuate nothing,” the
mule’s owner replied. “Our friend at the other end
of the table began this precaution, and it is no more
than polite to continue it. You will cut the cards
and kill the top half of the deck?”</p>

<p>The ensign did as he was requested and sat down
again. The mule’s owner put out a hand and took
the top card. He threw it face upward on the table.</p>

<p>“The ten of diamonds!” he said. “It is my lucky
card, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>Without hesitation the caballero drew the next
card and flipped it over.</p>

<p>“The king of diamonds!” he said. “’Tis by far
the luckier card in this instance, <i>señor</i>. I believe the
mule is mine?”</p>

<p>“The mule is yours—guitar and all.”</p>

<p>The caballero arose and bowed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>“Then I must depart from this hospitable post as
soon as the neophyte fetches the beast to the door,” he
said. “May I add, <i>señor</i>, that I hope you are able to
procure a horse within a short time?”</p>

<p>“Your solicitude for my welfare overwhelms me,”
said the man who owned the mule no longer. “I shall
be in San Diego de Alcalá before you, however.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish to make a wager concerning that?”</p>

<p>“A couple of pieces of gold, dear Claudio!”</p>

<p>“Done! It is only fair to say, however, that I shall
exchange the mule for a horse somewhere along the
highway. And I shall have many hours the start of
you.”</p>

<p>“Travellers along the highway are stopped at times,
my dear Claudio, even when they carry his excellency’s
pass.”</p>

<p>The caballero’s face darkened an instant as he looked
at the other man. Then he laughed nervously, and
emptied his wine cup with a single swallow, and arose.
He picked up the guitar and struck a chord or two, and
laughed again, almost in the other’s face. It was
bravado and insolence mingled.</p>

<p>Sergeant Cassara was growling admiration of the
caballero’s manner; the ensign feared trouble between
these two guests of his. To the ears of those in the
barracks-room came the tinklings of bells as a neophyte
led the mule to the door.</p>

<p>“I thank you for your hospitality, ensign,” the
caballero said. “Perhaps at some future day you may
be my guest. Here are a couple of pieces of gold—give
your soldiers wine in my name. Perhaps the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
neophyte will hand a piece to the padre at the mission
for me? I have not the time to stop.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see it done, <i>señor</i>,” the ensign replied.</p>

<p>“And do you continue your sword practice, sergeant,”
he went on. “You have the making of a fencer
in you, I do believe.”</p>

<p>“Now, by the good saint——”</p>

<p>“As for you, <i>señor</i>,” he continued, fating the man
who had owned the mule, “I suppose we’ll meet in
San Diego de Alcalá?”</p>

<p>“You may be sure of that, <i>señor</i>, if you live to reach
the mission there.”</p>

<p>“<i>Adios</i>, then, kind friends! I am none too familiar
with the gaits of a mule, yet no doubt I can make shift
to travel. Ah, yes! My guitar!”</p>

<p>He threw the cord around his neck and swung the
instrument to his back, then walked briskly to the
door. The others crowded after him, Sergeant Cassara
grinning from ear to ear as he watched the stormy face
of the man who had lost the mule.</p>

<p>The caballero put his own heavy saddle and bridle
on the beast and mounted. Once more he removed
his sombrero and bowed to them; and then he turned
the mule’s head, swung the guitar before him, struck
a chord, began to sing, and started off down the slope
toward El Camino Real.</p>

<p>Standing in the doorway, they watched until the
beast’s hoofs began kicking up clouds of the red dust.
Once the caballero waved his hat at them, then looked
back at the presidio no more. He passed the mission
at a trot, failing to greet a fray who stood beside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
wall. He made a turning where trees shut Santa
Barbara from his view, and then he raked the beast’s
sides with his spurs and urged it into a run.</p>

<p>Mile after mile he travelled beneath the burning
sun, half choked with the dust, his sombrero pulled
low down over his eyes, always alert where there was
a chance for ambush, now and then stopping at the
crest of a hill to look far ahead on the highway.</p>

<p>Evening came, and he stopped beside a creek to
drink and wash the dust from his face and hands, and
to water the mule. And then he went on through the
darkness, having difficulty at times keeping to the
highway, now and then stopping to listen as if for
pursuit. The moon rose, and he urged the mule to
greater speed.</p>

<p>He approached San Buenaventura, the dogs howling
when they caught the sound of the mule’s hoofs. An
Indian hailed him, but he did not stop. On and on
through the night he rode, mile after mile. Sixty
miles from San Buenaventura to San Fernando mission—a
good day’s journey—and he was determined to
make it in half the time!</p>

<p>Day came, and the sun beat down into the valley,
merciless alike to man and beast. He saw a skulking
gentile frequently, but always at a distance, and he
knew there was less possibility of bandits here. His
mule was fagged and seemed insensible to the spurs.
The dust had caked on the man’s face, his eyes were
swollen, and he suffered from thirst.</p>

<p>Now the highway followed a dry watercourse, and
now it ran along the rim of a hill. On the crests he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
stopped the mule and looked ahead, but never behind.
It was interruption he feared now, not pursuit. He
passed a flock of sheep being driven toward the north,
and the neophytes herding them looked at him in
astonishment when he refused to answer their respectful
salutations. Once more he stopped at a creek to
bathe his eyes and drink, allowing his beast to have
but a small amount of water and to nibble a few
minutes at the green growth along the bank.</p>

<p>Noon came; he reached the crest of a hill to see
the mission of San Fernando glistening white in the
distance. Urging the mule to greater speed, he passed
a rancho frequently, but did not stop for refreshment.
The mule was trotting with hanging head, negotiating
the rough highway with difficulty.</p>

<p>As he neared the mission the beast staggered and
fell, and a neophyte came running.</p>

<p>“The mule is yours if you can save him,” the caballero
said. “Remove saddle and bridle and bring them
after me. Where is the padre?”</p>

<p>“In the storehouse, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>The caballero hurried away. The padre had witnessed
his arrival and was walking slowly toward him.
They met beside the wall.</p>

<p>“I have immediate need of a good horse, padre,”
the caballero said. “I have gold to pay for the beast.”</p>

<p>“I can get you one in a short time, <i>señor</i>. You are
hurrying toward the south?”</p>

<p>“On an urgent matter, padre.”</p>

<p>“These are turbulent times, I am told. If the sainted
Serra were still among the living, to guide us——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span></p>

<p>“I have not said I am on business of state.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, <i>señor</i>. I was not attempting to
interfere in your personal affairs.”</p>

<p>“I have been riding all night,” the caballero went on.
“I came from Santa Barbara on a mule and almost
killed the beast. Get me a horse, and blessings be upon
your head! And food and wine, and a bit of water,
would not be amiss.”</p>

<p>The padre turned and led the way into the nearest
building. He placed food and wine upon a table there,
and sent for a horse. A neophyte entered and removed
the caballero’s boots and bathed his feet; another placed
a stone basin of water on the table, so that the traveller
could bathe face and hands.</p>

<p>The horse came, was declared fit, and the heavy bridle
and saddle put on the animal. The caballero, refreshed,
mounted and gathered up the reins.</p>

<p>“A bottle of wine and a package of cold mutton,
caballero,” the padre said, offering them. “No matter
how urgent a man’s business, he must eat and drink to
maintain his strength.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, padre. I would give you a piece of
gold, if I did not know you would refuse it. You have
given me much—give me now your blessing and let me
go on my way. It is a score of miles to Reina de Los
Angeles, I understand, and I would reach that pueblo
by nightfall.”</p>

<p>The padre gave his blessing, and stepped nearer the
horse’s head, seeming to look at the bridle.</p>

<p>“On the north side of the plaza at Reina de Los
Angeles,” he said, “there is a certain inn where some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
travellers would be none too safe. As you know, these
are turbulent times. On the south side, however, just
around the corner from the chapel, is a pretentious
house of adobe inhabited by a pious man known as
Gonzales. In that house a traveller of the right sort
may sleep with reason to believe that his throat will
not be slit before he awakens.”</p>

<p>“I understand, and thank you.”</p>

<p>“You may say that Fray Felipe vouches for you as
a gentleman of honesty.”</p>

<p>“Thank you again, padre. But how can you vouch
for me, never having seen me before?”</p>

<p>“A good priest is able to read men as well as books,
caballero. I once knew a pirate who was at heart an
honest man.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure that I gather your full meaning, but
I take it for granted, padre. If you will allow me, I
may drop the hint that another traveller will be along
the highway before many hours, coming from the
north. If he is riding a horse to death, it would be a
pious act to delay him until the animal is refreshed.”</p>

<p>“Though you tell me this, having just done your best
to slay a mule, I am of your opinion in the matter.
<i>Adios</i>, caballero!”</p>

<p>“<i>Adios</i>, padre! Your kindness will not be forgotten.”</p>

<p>The caballero put spurs to the horse’s flanks and
dashed down the highway. This was different from
riding the mule, for the padre had supplied him with
a noble steed fresh from pasturage, an animal of
spirit eager to cover broad miles at a rapid gait.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>He passed other riders now and then, the most of
them bound for the north. Frequently there were
flocks of sheep; here and there herds of cattle grazed
beside the highway. Carts drawn by oxen rumbled
toward the mission, carrying loads of grain; lumbering
carreta went by, in which elderly <i>señoras</i> rode, going
from one rancho to another, and at times a dimpled
<i>señorita</i> accompanied by a grim <i>duenna</i>.</p>

<p>Evening was descending as he neared Reina de Los
Angeles. His body ached, he scarcely could keep his
eyes open. Without stopping his horse, he drank the
wine and ate the cold meat the padre had provided.
As he approached nearer the pueblo he forced himself
to become alert again and take stock of his surroundings.
He slowed down his mount so as not to attract
undue attention. At the edge of the plaza he stopped
and looked about.</p>

<p>He saw the chapel, made out the inn regarding which
Padre Felipe had warned him, discerned the residence
of Gonzales. Toward this he rode, stopping at the
rear and ordering an Indian to fetch out the master. A
few minutes passed and Gonzales stood before him.</p>

<p>“Well, caballero?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Fray Felipe of San Fernando says that you are an
honest man, and vouches for me being one, though he
never set eyes on me until this day.”</p>

<p>“The good padre seldom makes a mistake in estimating
a man.”</p>

<p>“I believe he did say that once he knew a pirate with
an honest heart. I have ridden night and day without
rest, <i>señor</i>. I do not wish for food at present, yet I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
would have my horse cared for, and I would like to
sleep soundly until an hour before dawn. Fray Felipe
assured me a man could do that in your house without
having his throat slit before morning.”</p>

<p>“That is true, caballero,” Gonzales said, smiling a
little. “The Indian will care for your horse. Enter,
and I will have your couch prepared, and sit up myself
to watch over you. You may trust me, caballero. I am
that pirate of whom the good padre spoke!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III"><span class="tall-2">CHAPTER III<br></span>

<span class="s8">MYSTERIES</span></h2>

<p>It was still dark when Gonzales entered the room
with a candle and shook the caballero until he
was awake. The rider of the highway found that
his clothes had been brushed and neatly folded, that his
boots had been greased, and that a huge stone basin
filled with cool water stood ready.</p>

<p>He plunged his head in the water, dried his face, and
went to the adjoining room after dressing, there to
find a table heaped high with food. The caballero ate
ravenously, scarcely speaking. An Indian entered and
spoke to Gonzales in whispers.</p>

<p>“Your horse is ready, <i>señor</i>,” Gonzales said. “It is
a fit animal, able to cover many miles during a day. I
have no wish to bereft myself of your companionship
by sending you on your way, yet perhaps it would suit
your purpose best to be well on the road to San Juan
Capistrano by daybreak.”</p>

<p>“Your idea is an excellent one, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing more I can do to serve you?”</p>

<p>“You have been kindness itself.”</p>

<p>“There is, perhaps, some message?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of prime importance at this time, <i>señor</i>. I
am eager to reach San Diego de Alcalá at the earliest
possible moment.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“If you need an Indian——”</p>

<p>“The highway stretches plainly before one, <i>señor</i>,
and an Indian would but delay me.”</p>

<p>“I understand that these are turbulent times——”</p>

<p>“So the good Fray Felipe said at San Fernando. No
doubt it is a true word.”</p>

<p>“You mystify me, <i>señor</i>, in a measure. Yet a man
should not speculate regarding that which does not
concern him.”</p>

<p>“Very true, Señor Gonzales. I might mention that
another traveller may journey along El Camino Real
at an early day, as soon as he can procure a horse at
Santa Barbara, where I left him behind. I doubt
whether he will receive cordial welcome from Fray
Felipe—as you say, the good padre is an excellent judge
of men. It would not desolate me much if this person
were delayed now and then.”</p>

<p>“Ah! His name?”</p>

<p>“He travels incognito with a pass signed by his
excellency, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Then—?” There was a puzzled expression on
Gonzales’ face.</p>

<p>“I travel in such manner myself.”</p>

<p>“Still, I do not see——”</p>

<p>“It is not for me to criticise his excellency, yet I may
say that on a busy day he might issue a pass by mistake,
or without having proper investigation.”</p>

<p>“Can you not speak to me as man to man, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“I regret that I have no information that may be
given you. And I must be on my way. Here is a
piece of gold——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>“Not from you, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are making a mistake. Perhaps you
think me a man I am not. I have given you no reason
to believe——”</p>

<p>“If I made a mistake, <i>señor</i>, then Fray Felipe of San
Fernando makes one also, and I have learned to trust
his judgment.”</p>

<p>“Then I thank you for your hospitality and kindness,”
the caballero replied.</p>

<p>Gonzales led the way out of the house to where the
horse was waiting beside the adobe wall. He held a
stirrup while the caballero mounted.</p>

<p>“You know the way?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Until this journey, I never have been south of
Monterey,” the rider answered.</p>

<p>“Once you are away from the pueblo the highway
is plainly to be seen. I have had my own horse made
ready and will accompany you for a short distance.”</p>

<p>“I thank you again, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>The Indian led out the second horse. Gonzales
mounted, and they started out across the plaza, to
follow a tiny trail that ran from one side of it between
two rows of Indian huts. No word was spoken until
they were a mile from the pueblo. Daybreak showed
the dusty highway stretching toward the south, twisting
like a great serpent across the land.</p>

<p>“Here I leave you,” Gonzales said. “I wish you
good fortune, <i>señor</i>, and am yours to command if there
are things you wish done. If the times are indeed
turbulent, as has been intimated, perhaps my old trade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
of pirate will stand me in good stead. <i>Adios</i>, caballero!
My blessings go with you!”</p>

<p>“Having been blessed by both padre and pirate, I can
scarcely go wrong,” the caballero replied.</p>

<p>He raised his hand in salute, whirled his horse,
touched the animal with his spurs and galloped toward
the south, sending up great clouds of dust behind him.
Gonzales watched him for several minutes, then, shaking
his head in perplexity, turned and started back
toward Reina de Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Now that he was on the highway again, the caballero
became alert, watching the trail whenever he topped
a hill, hand on pistol-butt where brush edged the road
and made an ambush possible.</p>

<p>Sixty miles to the south was San Juan Capistrano,
and the caballero did not spare his horse. During the
morning he saw few men, either red or white. In the
distance, at times, he could see the white buildings of
some rancho, and grazing herds, and frequently a small
orchard.</p>

<p>Then, as he neared the mission, he came upon scenes
of activity, oxen-drawn carts loaded with grain, carreta,
squads of Indians working on the highway as punishment
for some trivial offence.</p>

<p>The miles flew beneath his horse’s hoofs, and in
time he could see the mission building glistening in the
sun, throngs of neophytes at work, scores of children
playing about the walls. The children scattered at his
approach, to stand, half in fear and half in curiosity,
some distance away and regard him thoughtfully. He
dismounted stiffly, but no man gave him greeting.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
Leading his horse he walked to the door of the nearest
storehouse. A fray came out and faced him.</p>

<p>“I am journeying to San Diego de Alcalá, and have
need of a fresh mount,” the caballero said. “I will
trade or purchase.”</p>

<p>“I have no horse for you, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! San Juan Capistrano is well known for
its breed. At Santa Barbara they told me you were to
send them steeds within the month, in exchange for
fruit and wine.”</p>

<p>“We sell and give horses to whom we will, <i>señor</i>,
and withhold them from others.”</p>

<p>“What is the meaning of that?” the caballero demanded.
His face had flushed with sudden anger, for
he did not like the fray’s tone or manner. “I have a
pass here signed by His Excellency the Governor. You
will scarcely refuse to accommodate me now, I take it.”</p>

<p>The fray read the pass and handed it back.</p>

<p>“It passes my understanding that you possess such
a paper,” he said. “Yet, on the other hand, it is not
a matter to excite wonder. It is understood that the
Governor is not particular to whom he issues passes.”</p>

<p>“I shall take it upon myself to see you punished for
your insolence, fray! A man who wears a gown should
know more of courtesy.”</p>

<p>“There is no horse here for you, <i>señor</i>. I have
spoken.”</p>

<p>“You are not the only horse owner in San Juan
Capistrano!”</p>

<p>“No man here will sell you one, nor give it you, nor
make an exchange.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“And why is that?”</p>

<p>“Need you question?”</p>

<p>“Most certainly I question. This is the first discourtesy
I have found along El Camino Real. Even
the soldiers at the Santa Barbara presidio aided me on
my way, gave me food and wine. The good fray at
San Fernando recommended me to a friend in Reina de
Los Angeles. And here, it appears, one cannot even
buy a horse with gold. I await your explanation, fray.”</p>

<p>“I have no explanation to give you, <i>señor</i>, nor do I
recognise your right to one. If the frailes to the north
have been misled, I have nothing to say. We of the
south, however, have scant courtesy for men of a
certain stamp.”</p>

<p>“Now by the good saints——!”</p>

<p>“The good saints are better off your lips, <i>señor</i>!”
cried the fray angrily.</p>

<p>Neophytes had been crowding about, drawn by the
quarrel. The caballero whirled upon them, to find
some grinning. His hand dropped to his sword-hilt.</p>

<p>“The road stretches toward the south, <i>señor</i>,” the
fray resumed. “And we are crowded here in San
Juan Capistrano.”</p>

<p>“You are ordering me away, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“I am leaving it to your good judgment to go.”</p>

<p>“I am not a man to be trifled with, fray. This discourtesy
is like to cost you dear!”</p>

<p>“I pay my debts, <i>señor</i>. If it costs me, I pay.”</p>

<p>“You refuse to respect the Governor’s pass?”</p>

<p>“I refuse to recognise your right to have it,” the
fray replied. He turned about and started inside the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
storehouse. The caballero took a quick step forward
and clutched the other by the shoulder and whirled
him around.</p>

<p>“Cloth or no cloth, no man treats me like this!” he
exclaimed. “A horse—immediately!”</p>

<p>The fray uttered an exclamation; the neophytes
crowded closer. Releasing his man, the caballero drew
his sword and turned upon them.</p>

<p>“Back, dogs!” he cried. “I do not like your stench!
And you, fray, fetch me a horse, before I run you
through!”</p>

<p>“You——!” The fray seemed to grow taller in his
sudden anger. “You dare to threaten me, <i>señor</i>? A
man of your stripe——”</p>

<p>“I have had enough of this mystery!”</p>

<p>“Out of my sight! Take your way to the south, or
the north if it pleases you, but quit San Juan Capistrano
this minute! Else I will not be responsible——”</p>

<p>“For what! For what may happen to me?” The
caballero laughed aloud, half in anger, half in jest.
His sword described an arc. But the neophytes did
not fall back from before him; the fray made a sign
and they closed in.</p>

<p>His back against the wall of the storehouse, the
caballero swept his blade through the air again, and
held his pistol in his left hand. The Indians hesitated
a moment, the caballero advanced.</p>

<p>“Back!” the caballero cried.</p>

<p>Again they closed in, rushed. A screech of pain
came from the first he touched with the blade. His
pistol spoke and a man fell wounded. In that instant,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
as they hesitated, he was among them, his blade darting
here and there. Purposely he avoided clashing with
the fray, always keeping neophytes between them, for
to wound a fray, he knew, would be to make bloodthirsty
wretches of the red men. Foot by foot he
fought his way to where the horse was standing with
lowered head.</p>

<p>He drove back those nearest, then sprang to the
saddle and dashed away. The guitar had been fastened
to the saddle, and now it snapped its cord and fell to
the ground. Laughing loudly, the caballero turned his
horse, galloped back among the neophytes, scattering
them right and left, swung down from his saddle and
caught up the instrument, waved it above his head in
derision, and was away again.</p>

<p>A pistol spoke behind him, a bullet whistled past his
head, but he rode unscathed. A mile away he stopped
the horse to wipe the bloody blade on his cloak and
return it to its scabbard.</p>

<p>“A courteous reception indeed!” he muttered, and
gave his horse the spurs.</p>

<p>A journey of twenty-five miles stretched before
him to the next mission in the chain, San Luis Rey de
Francia. He did not urge his mount to its utmost,
for he did not want to exhaust the beast, and he knew
better time would be made travelling a level gait.</p>

<p>Here the highway ran along the sea, and for a time
the caballero allowed his horse to walk knee-deep in the
tumbling water. Anger still flushed his face; his eyes
still were blazing. With a fresh horse procured at San
Juan Capistrano he would have been able to reach San<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
Luis Rey de Francia long before nightfall; whereas,
because of his reception at the last mission, he would
reach it after dark, if at all, for the hills were near, and
common report had it that even daylight riding there
was perilous enough for a gentleman unattended.</p>

<p>He drove his horse up the slope and to the highway
proper again and looked ahead. A dust cloud was in
the distance, and in time he made out a herd of cattle
being driven along the road. He saw, as he neared
them, that there were two Indian herders, and stopped
to recharge his pistol. They might prove to be harmless
neophytes; they might be thieving gentiles running off
mission cattle, and ready to give battle to a traveller.</p>

<p>He stood his horse at one side of the highway as they
passed, alert for trouble. They were talking, he could
see, and pointing at him, but he could not hear their
words. Long after they had gone by, the two Indians
turned frequently to look in his direction.</p>

<p>The caballero rode on, with some speed now, since
it was growing late in the afternoon. Overhanging
crags, jumbles of rock, clumps of scrawny trees cast
shadows across the highway and furnished cover for
bandits, but he met with no adventure. Through the
twilight he galloped, stopping before each hidden curve
to listen, straining his eyes to discern the presence of
a foe.</p>

<p>Night came, and in the distance he saw lights at San
Luis Rey de Francia.</p>

<p>“Let us hope there are men of brains to be found
here,” the caballero muttered. “I must have food,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
drink, rest. It does not matter so much about a horse
now, since my own will be refreshed by morning.”</p>

<p>Now there were huts beside the highway, but all in
them seemed sleeping. Dogs howled as he approached.
Ahead of him, a door was thrown open, and a streak
of light pierced the darkness. He rode toward it.</p>

<p>An Indian stood there holding a crude torch above
his head, an aged Indian with scraggy hair and wrinkled
face.</p>

<p>“I want food, rest,” the caballero said. “Where
sleeps a fray that will awaken easily?”</p>

<p>The Indian stared at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>“You seek a fray?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Else I would not ask the whereabouts of one.”</p>

<p>“It is a bold thing to do, <i>señor</i>. It would be better,
would it not, to accept the hospitality of my poor hut,
and be sure you are with friends? Scant welcome will
you get from a fray. Enter, <i>señor</i>, and honour my
poor dwelling. I have food and wine, and a couch. I
will see that your horse has attention, and all night I’ll
watch, and before the dawn comes I’ll awaken you and
send you on your way.”</p>

<p>“This thing passes my understanding, yet I am weary
enough to accept the quickest relief,” the caballero
said. “If you attempt treachery——”</p>

<p>“Then may I die, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“That probably would come to pass in such event.”</p>

<p>He dismounted and began taking off the saddle.
The Indian ran to help him and got a halter for use
instead of the bridle. The horse was picketed beside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span>
the road and thrown hay and grain. Then the Indian
led the way into the hut.</p>

<p>It was of adobe, small, round. A table was built
into one wall, a bunk into another. While the caballero
sat on the bunk to rest, his host put out cold meat
and wine and dried wheat-paste. The guest ate, and
not sparingly, and then removed his boots and threw
himself down on the couch.</p>

<p>“I will sit outside and watch the door, <i>señor</i>,” the
Indian said. “You may sleep without fear.”</p>

<p>“But with a pistol ready at my hand,” the caballero
growled.</p>

<p>After the Indian had gone, he arose and extinguished
the torch, and listened for a moment at the door, until
he was sure his host was squatting there. It was
troubled sleep he had, for the surroundings were peculiar,
and he did not fully trust his host.</p>

<p>A step beside the couch caused him to awaken and
spring to his feet, pistol held ready.</p>

<p>“Within an hour, <i>señor</i>, it will be dawn,” he heard
the voice of the old Indian say. “I have more wine
and food ready, and water fresh from the spring. It
is better that you are gone before others awake, then
none will know of your passing.”</p>

<p>The caballero ate again, and followed his host outside,
carrying saddle and bridle. When the horse was
ready, he mounted, then tossed the native a coin.</p>

<p>“No, <i>señor</i>—not from you, if you please,” the Indian
said. “It has been a pleasure——”</p>

<p>“White man and red—both give me hospitality and
refuse payment,” remarked the caballero. “At times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
I think myself the most fortunate of men, at other
times the most unlucky. One fray aids me and another
refuses to sell me a horse. It is a peculiar world!”</p>

<p>“The <i>señor</i> will not forget me—that is all I ask,”
the Indian muttered.</p>

<p>“Be assured I will not! <i>Adios!</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>’Dios!</i>”</p>

<p>The caballero trotted his steed for a mile, then
broke into a gallop. Forty miles more, and he would
be at San Diego de Alcalá, his journey’s end. He
laughed aloud as the dawn came and showed him the
sea sparkling in the distance. His spirits had revived
wonderfully.</p>

<p>“Poor self-styled Juan who once owned a mule!”
he murmured. “He loses a couple of pieces of gold,
I take it, since it is not to be believed that he has
reached the goal before me. I wonder what would
have happened if I had gone to the inn on the plaza
at Reina de Los Angeles?”</p>

<p>He was in the hills again now, yet the highway
was seldom masked, and he felt secure in the knowledge
that a foe could not approach without being
seen. The miles flew beneath his horse’s hoofs. A
cool breeze came in from the sea and neutralised the
heat of the sun. In the distance he could see a broad
valley, and he knew that the end of his journey was
near.</p>

<p>Another ten miles, and then, stopping his horse
on the crest of a hill, he saw San Diego de Alcalá
before him. Near the shore of the bay was the presidio,
topping a knoll. Six miles up the valley was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
the mission proper, and near it an orchard surrounded
by a wall, and fields of green.</p>

<p>“’Tis a bit of paradise in the wilderness!” the
caballero said aloud. “And there is an angel in it,
I have heard.”</p>

<p>He chuckled and urged the horse on. Purposely
he avoided the presidio for the time being and made
his way toward the mission. Only a few neophytes
were to be seen, and even they disappeared as he
approached.</p>

<p>The mission buildings formed three sides of a
square; the fourth side was an adobe wall nearly ten
feet high. Through a space between two of the buildings
the caballero rode his horse. Not a human being
was to be seen in the plaza.</p>

<p>“This is mighty peculiar,” the caballero muttered.</p>

<p>He dismounted and let the horse stand in the shade
of the wall. Every door was closed, even those of the
padres’ quarters, the hospital, the guest house.</p>

<p>“Awake, good people!” he cried. “Is it the fashion
here to take a siesta in the cool of the day?”</p>

<p>The door of the padres’ quarters did not open; no
big-eyed Indian child ran out to stare at him, finger in
mouth, half curious and half afraid; no man or woman
appeared from a hut.</p>

<p>He slapped the dust from his clothes and started
across the plaza toward the padres’ quarters, determined
to pound on the big door until it was opened
and the lethargy of the place explained.</p>

<p>Around the end of the wall there came a neophyte
stooping beneath a bag of grain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span></p>

<p>“Good day, <i>señor</i>!” said the caballero. “I am glad
to find someone alive.”</p>

<p>The Indian stared at him, hesitated a moment, then
walked on without speaking.</p>

<p>The door of the storehouse opened, and another
man walked into the plaza, one who carried a quarter
of beef on his shoulder. He followed a narrow path
that ran toward one of the huts, so that he had to
pass within a dozen feet of the caballero.</p>

<p>“Perhaps here is a man with brains,” the new-comer
thought. Aloud, he said: “<i>Señor</i>, it is a brilliant day!”</p>

<p>The man who carried the beef did not slacken his
pace, but he glanced at the caballero from beneath
shaggy brows, and passed without making a reply.
Behind him in the narrow path stood one astonished
and angry.</p>

<p>“It is a settlement of imbeciles and deaf mutes, this
San Diego de Alcalá!” he growled.</p>

<p>Now there was a burst of laughter from the end of
the wall, and into view came an Indian girl of perhaps
fourteen, her black hair streaming down her back, her
feet and legs bare, her arms filled with wild blossoms.
Behind her was a youth a few years her senior. When
they saw the caballero they stopped quickly, and the
youth said something to the girl, then they ceased their
laughter and hurried along the path.</p>

<p>“<i>Señor! Señorita!</i>” said the caballero, removing his
sombrero and bowing to the ground.</p>

<p>The youth growled something beneath his breath and
hurried on without responding to the greeting; the girl
tilted her nose and she would not meet the caballero’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
eyes. And so they passed him and continued across
the plaza toward the padres’ quarters, not once looking
back.</p>

<p>“Mute fools!” the caballero growled, his face flushed
because of his embarrassment.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV"><span class="tall-2">CHAPTER IV<br></span>

<span class="s8">A COYOTE HOWLS</span></h2>

<p>Adjoining the quarters of the padres was a
long adobe building used as a storehouse, and
sounds indicated that a man was at work inside.
It was towards the storehouse that the caballero
now hurried, something of anger in his manner, his
face still flushed, his dark eyes snapping and his chin
thrust out in aggressive fashion.</p>

<p>Seeing a face peering at him from one of the
windows, he gave it scant attention, but lifted the latch,
and the door of the storehouse flew open at his touch.</p>

<p>For an instant he stood in the doorway trying to
see, for the sun outside was bright, and inside there
was a semi-gloom. Then he made out a rough counter,
piles of skins from cattle and sheep, sacks of grain,
casks of tallow, bolts of imported goods, and a man
who paced back and forth before a rough desk, his
hands clasped behind his back, his head bowed on his
breast.</p>

<p>“Good day, <i>señor</i>!” said the caballero.</p>

<p>The other stopped and raised his head, looked the
caballero straight in the eyes, then, without a word,
stepped behind the counter and busied himself arranging
some bolts of cloth on a shelf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>“I greeted you good day, <i>señor</i>!”</p>

<p>Still there was no reply, nor did the man behind the
counter turn to face the one who spoke.</p>

<p>“Is there man, woman or child in the mission who
can speak Spanish, native or the sign language?” demanded
the caballero now, angrily, stepping up to the
counter and placing both his hands upon it. “Is this
the hospitality of which San Diego de Alcalá has been
so proud? Those persons I met in the plaza refused to
answer my polite salutations. And you—I take it you
are a sort of manager here, or superintendent, or clerk
to the padres, or something of the sort—seem to have
no word for me, not even the one common courtesy
demands you should use in response to a greeting!”</p>

<p>He waited; but an answer did not come. The
man behind the counter had finished with the bolts of
cloth, and now was taking from the shelf jars of honey
and olives and oil, and putting them back exactly as they
had been before, showing plainly that he was busying
himself merely to avoid making a reply.</p>

<p>“Has life in the bright sun dulled your wits?” demanded
the caballero, now thoroughly angry. “Have
you all taken a vow not to speak until such and such a
time? Could I get your kind attention, perhaps, if I
made a purchase? One would think an Indian attack
had left you all without tongues in your heads!”</p>

<p>Still there came no reply from the man behind the
counter.</p>

<p>The door opened, and a giant of a neophyte entered.
He gave the caballero a glance, seemed to throw back
his shoulders, and hurried up to the counter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>“A quarter of mutton, Señor Lopez,” he said. “The
padre said I was to have it until the grain is harvested.”</p>

<p>“Certainly, Pedro,” came the reply.</p>

<p>Señor Lopez turned and smiled at the man he had
called Pedro, and went to the rear of the room, from
where he carried the meat. Pedro took the mutton
upon his shoulder, and Señor Lopez followed him to
the door, opening it and holding it wide so that the
other could pass out. For a moment they talked in
low tones, then Pedro hurried away, and Lopez closed
the door and went back behind the counter.</p>

<p>“So you can use your voice when it pleases you
to do so, it seems,” said the caballero. “Suppose you
use a portion of it now, in answer to some questioning
of mine. If it is necessary, I’ll pay for it. Give
me this much voice, Señor Lopez!”</p>

<p>He threw a gold coin down upon the counter so
that it rang. Lopez turned slowly and faced him,
looked him straight in the eyes a moment, then went
back to the shelf and began arranging the jars again.</p>

<p>If the eyes of the caballero had snapped before, they
blazed now. He placed both hands upon the counter
as if to spring over it and throttle the man who refused
to speak, but he seemed to decide against that,
and the smile came upon his face again, only the quality
of the smile was not the same.</p>

<p>On one end of the counter was a heap of small stone
jars, filled, evidently with fruit and oil. The caballero
picked up a bar of metal from the counter, walked
deliberately to the heap of jars, and crashed the heavy
bar down among them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>Señor Lopez jumped as if he had been shot, and
turned to see the caballero standing before the ruin,
the inscrutable smile still upon his lips. He raised the
bar again, and again he crashed it among the jars,
sending fruit and oil to the floor.</p>

<p>“<i>Señor!</i>” Lopez cried.</p>

<p>“I thought that would make you find your voice. As
for the damage, I’ll pay it. Now suppose you open
your lips and explain this strange conduct, before I
get genuinely angry and carry on the work of destruction.”</p>

<p>Their eyes clashed for a moment, and then Lopez
spoke:</p>

<p>“I open my lips this once, and after that, <i>señor</i>,
perhaps you will go back up El Camino Real and admit
yourself a beaten man. San Diego de Alcalá has a
name for hospitality, it is true, but there is none even
here for Captain Fly-by-Night.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said the caballero, “that I have
heard that name before.”</p>

<p>“It is known from San Francisco de Asis to San
Diego de Alcalá, <i>señor</i>, without credit to the man who
bears it.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>“We play at words, <i>señor</i>, and that is not necessary.
News of your coming was received several days ago.
When the news went up El Camino Real that the good
Señor Fernandez had gone the way of all flesh and left
to his fair daughter, Anita, and her very distant
relative, Rojerio Rocha, the fortune and broad acres
he had acquired by a lifetime of hard work and danger,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
you boasted, before the body of the <i>señor</i> was scarcely
cold in the ground, that here was a fair maid and a
fortune to be won, and that you could and would win
them.”</p>

<p>“I boasted that, eh?”</p>

<p>“’Tis well known, Captain Fly-by-Night. You
boasted loudly. Even when it became known that
Rojerio Rocha was to come down El Camino Real from
distant San Francisco de Asis and wed his distant
relative, and be the head of the great rancho, you
boasted that, betrothal or no, you’d win Señorita Anita
and the rancho would be yours.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“Many a mission and presidio, and many a rancho,
you have visited during your career, Captain Fly-by-Night,
always to leave behind you broken hearts and
empty purses. Your skill with the cards and dice, it
is said, is such as to be almost supernatural. There is
another explanation for it, of course. Your way with
women, too, has been made notorious. But never did
you come near San Diego de Alcalá while Señor
Fernandez was alive, knowing well what to expect if
you did. Now that he is dead, you dare to come, after
making your boasts.”</p>

<p>“I am learning things regarding myself,” said the
caballero.</p>

<p>“When we heard of your boast, we considered what
to do,” Lopez went on. “Did the padres let the men
of the mission whip you and send you back up El
Camino Real, as they should, you could say that you
had no chance, one man against so many score, and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
moreover, the well-known hospitality of San Diego de
Alcalá would be outraged. So we decided upon another
course, Captain Fly-by-Night.</p>

<p>“The country is both long and broad, and we do not
say you cannot live in it. But so far as San Diego de
Alcalá and its people are concerned—ranch owner, fray,
neophyte or soldier—you do not exist, <i>señor</i>. No man,
woman or child will speak to you. You can purchase
neither food nor wine here. The sweet <i>señorita</i> whose
name you have insulted with your boasts will pass
within half a dozen feet of you and see you not. You
will be a nothing, not given as much consideration as
a coyote. Do you understand me, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“You speak plainly enough,” the caballero replied.</p>

<p>“If you wish to remain under those conditions, we
will make no effort to prevent you. When Rojerio
Rocha arrives—and he is expected within a few days—and
weds our fair Anita, being then in the position of
a husband, he may see fit to chastise you for your ill-timed
boasts. If you care to admit that you boasted
once too often, and wish to return to the north, there is
grain and hay for your horse at the end of the wall, and
we will not call it theft if you feed your animal. Your
absence would be well worth the price of a few measures
of grain.”</p>

<p>“That is all you have to say, Señor Lopez?”</p>

<p>“I have opened my lips to tell you how things stand,
Captain Fly-by-Night. Hereafter they shall remain
closed in your presence.”</p>

<p>“If there should be some mistake about that
boast——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>Lopez looked at the caballero, then turned toward
the shelf and began arranging the jars again. The
anger was dying out of the face of the caballero now,
and the smile that came upon his lips was more inscrutable
than before.</p>

<p>“At least, I leave the coin in payment for the
damage I have caused,” he said; and started toward
the door.</p>

<p>He heard the quick step of Lopez behind him, but
did not turn. He threw the door open wide, and
stepped out. Something whizzed past his head and
struck the ground before him. He looked at it—the
coin he had left on the counter.</p>

<p>As he walked back across the plaza to where he had
left his horse, the caballero chuckled like a man well
pleased. There was no anger in his face or bearing
now, no resentment, rather lively satisfaction. He
passed the giant Pedro talking with another neophyte,
and when they turned their backs to him and continued
their conversation as if he had not been near he laughed
outright.</p>

<p>He led his horse from the plaza and down the slope,
and there he removed saddle and bridle and picketed
the animal where green grass grew along a trickling
brook. Walking some distance from the mission he
shot a rabbit, and, carrying the game back to where
he had left the horse, he cleaned it with his knife,
washed it in the creek, and hung it up on a forked stick.</p>

<p>Then he arranged dry moss and grass for a fire,
being particular to build it where it could be seen easily
from the guest house of the mission and from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
padres’ quarters; and he knew that every action was
being watched, that men and women might keep silent,
but could not curb their curiosity.</p>

<p>He had no flint and steel, neither did he know how
to make fire by the Indian method, and he found himself
now facing a predicament. But there were glass
buttons on his cloak, and from one of them he made
a burning glass, and crouching over the dry grass
focused the sun’s beams and in time had a blaze.</p>

<p>He cooked the rabbit, ate it without salt, put more fuel
on the fire, then spread his cloak on the ground, picked
up the guitar, and began playing softly. Presently he
sang, his voice ringing out across the plaza and reaching
the ears of those in the mission.</p>

<p>Now and then an Indian child came to the end of the
adobe wall and watched and listened. Men and women
passed from hut to hut, but none paid the slightest
attention to him. Smoke poured from chimneys, and
there were odours of meals being prepared. His singing
and playing over for a time, the caballero sat with
his back against a rock, his sombrero tilted over his
eyes, and rested.</p>

<p>Presently he saw the door of the guest house open,
and out of it came a vision of female loveliness that
caused the caballero to catch his breath. Behind her
walked an elderly <i>duenna</i> of proud carriage.</p>

<p>“This will be the fair Anita, with some <i>señora</i> in
attendance,” the caballero chuckled. “I wonder if they
intend paying me a visit?”</p>

<p>It looked it, for the girl led the way down the slope
and toward the creek, walking with head proudly lifted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
the elderly <i>señora</i> tripping at her heels. They passed
within twenty feet of the caballero, but the girl did not
look his way. The other woman, however, glanced at
him from the corners of her eyes, and he smiled at her
curiosity.</p>

<p>They stopped beside the creek, and the girl filled a
small jar with water, and began arranging wild flowers
in it, while the <i>señora</i> stood beside her, looking down
the valley toward the presidio.</p>

<p>“To think,” voiced Anita Fernandez, “that a husband
is to come to me up El Camino Real all the way
from San Francisco de Asis—a husband and distant
relative at one and the same time! To marry a man I
never have seen before—is that not a hardship, Señora
Vallejo?”</p>

<p>“Rojerio Rocha,” Señora Vallejo replied, “undoubtedly
will be a gentleman, a pattern of a man and
an excellent husband. There will be ample time for
courtship after he arrives; there is no need for rushing
the marriage ceremony. You do not have to wed him
if he is not a proper man.”</p>

<p>“But my father wished it,” Anita said.</p>

<p>“Your father knew that Rojerio Rocha had been
left without much of the world’s goods. He is of a
very distant branch of the family; yet your father
desired to see him better equipped with wealth. He
desired your marriage to Rojerio Rocha, knowing the
man’s good blood, but above all things he would desire,
were he still on earth, your happiness. You can make
up your mind, my dear Anita, after Rojerio Rocha
arrives.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span></p>

<p>“I wonder what he will be like, how he will appear,
whether he can smile and sing, and speak kindly.”</p>

<p>“All of that, whether it be Rocha or Fernandez
blood in his veins,” said Señora Vallejo.</p>

<p>“I shall, indeed, be glad to see him. How long it
has been since a stranger of quality came to us out of
the north!”</p>

<p>The man beside the fire chuckled at that, and got
up to walk slowly down the slope toward them. Six
feet away he swept his sombrero from his head and
bowed his best, and he smiled when he spoke.</p>

<p>“I believe I have the pleasure of addressing Señorita
Anita Fernandez?” he said.</p>

<p>“Señora Vallejo, did you speak?” asked the girl,
without looking at the man beside her.</p>

<p>“’Twas a coyote barked,” Señora Vallejo replied.</p>

<p>“Indeed, my poor voice may seem like the barking of
a coyote to one with a true musical ear,” the caballero
said, “though some have said it is near perfect in
tone.”</p>

<p>“Are you mumbling, Señora Vallejo?” Anita demanded.</p>

<p>“I am not, Anita, dear. It is the wind whistling
through the olive trees.”</p>

<p>“Ah! We grow with acquaintance!” said the
caballero, lightly. “At first my voice sounded like the
barking of a coyote, and now it sounds like the whistling
of the wind through the trees. We grow more musical,
indeed.”</p>

<p>Señora Vallejo bit her lip, and resolutely kept her
face from that of the man standing beside her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span></p>

<p>“Do you suppose, Señora Vallejo,” asked Anita,
“that the odious Captain Fly-by-Night will have the
audacity to come to San Diego de Alcalá, as he boasted
he would do? Has the man no brains at all, no sense
of the fitness of things? San Diego de Alcalá is no
place for gamblers such as he. He pollutes the plaza
if he walks across it!”</p>

<p>“No doubt the creature is senseless enough to come,”
said Señora Vallejo. She dabbed at her face with a
lace handkerchief, and, in dabbing, dropped it. In an
instant the caballero was down upon one knee, had
picked up the handkerchief, and, remaining on one knee,
tendered it.</p>

<p>“Permit me, <i>señora</i>,” he said.</p>

<p>Señora Vallejo’s hand went out, but there flashed
from the eyes of Anita Fernandez a warning, and the
hand was withdrawn. The caballero arose and tendered
the handkerchief again, to have Señora Vallejo
turn her back and face the girl.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, Anita dear, we should return now,” she
said. “Evening approaches, and there will be a fog
rolling up the valley.”</p>

<p>“As you please, Señora Vallejo.”</p>

<p>The girl turned from the creek and started walking
up the slope. The caballero stood in the path before
her, determined. Anita Fernandez stopped, and
seemed to look through him and at the mission beyond.
From the adobe wall hurried Pedro, the giant neophyte,
who had been watching and feared an affront
to the women.</p>

<p>“You are being annoyed, <i>señorita</i>?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span></p>

<p>“How could that be?” she demanded, laughing
lightly. “There is none here to annoy me, unless it
be Señora Vallejo.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, <i>señorita</i>. I thought I heard
someone speak.”</p>

<p>“’Twas but the distant barking of a coyote, Pedro.
You may follow us to the guest house, if you wish.
I will give you something for your little girl.”</p>

<p>They started toward the caballero again and for a
moment it seemed that they must recognise his presence.
But Anita Fernandez had a subterfuge to prevent that.
Just before reaching him, she turned aside, and the
others followed.</p>

<p>“I must speak to the padre about the neophytes
allowing rubbish to collect so near the mission,” she
said. “It always should be burned. Look at the stuff
here!”</p>

<p>She pointed to the caballero’s cloak, and with one
tiny foot she kicked scornfully at the guitar. Then she
swerved back toward the path again, and the others
followed her toward the plaza. The caballero picked
up the guitar and pressed his lips to the place where her
foot had struck, knowing well that Señora Vallejo was
watching him, though she pretended not to be.</p>

<p>He looked after them until the girl and woman had
passed around the end of the adobe wall and Pedro
had gone to his own hut. Darkness was gathering
rapidly now; lights appeared in the buildings; before
the door of the storehouse sat a circle of men, talking
and laughing, sipping bowls of wine. Sitting on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
ground, his back against a rock, the caballero watched
the scene.</p>

<p>“A beautiful woman,” he mused. “Proud, spirited,
kind though she does not suspect it, naturally intelligent,
very much to be desired.”</p>

<p>One by one the lights in the buildings disappeared.
The men before the storehouse crept away to rest. A
fray called to a neophyte standing guard. And then
there was no noise save for the singing of the breeze
through the orchard, and the distant howling of a
coyote.</p>

<p>Presently the caballero arose and picked up his
guitar, and crept up the slope until he reached the adobe
wall. He followed it to the end of the plaza; made his
way slowly through the darkness to the guest house.
There he stationed himself below an open window and
began playing softly. Several minutes he played,
knowing a neophyte stood a score of feet away, watching;
and then he began to sing a love song of Old
Spain, a song of strong men and fair women. Between
two verses he heard the voice of Señora Vallejo.</p>

<p>“Anita, child, do you hear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Señora Vallejo,” the girl replied, clearly.
“The coyotes are growing bold again. One is howling
now beneath my window.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_V"><span class="tall-2">CHAPTER V<br></span>

<span class="s8">TWO GOOD SAMARITANS</span></h2>

<p>It is a matter of history—that big rain of a certain
year. The torrents poured from the sky at an
unexpected time until the country was drenched
and tiny streams swollen, and watercourses that
had been dry were turned into turbulent yellow floods
that carried on the surface brush and grass and logs
from the hills, menacing many a rancho, undermining
huts and adobe houses, ruining wells.</p>

<p>Returning from his ineffectual serenade, the caballero
observed that the stars were disappearing, but believed
it was because of a fog that came from the sea. As
he reached the place where he had picketed his horse
and built his fire, a drop of water splashed on his
cheek. At the most, he anticipated nothing worse than
half an hour’s shower, and so he merely built up his
fire and put some dry moss and grass to one side under
his cloak, and prepared to sleep on the ground.</p>

<p>He slept soundly after his long journey and the
unexpected events of the past two days. He awoke
to find the fire out and a chill in his body, to find
that water was flowing down the slope about him, and
the ground but a sea of mud, with the torrent continuing
to pour from the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>It was not more than midnight and the storm gave
no indication of ceasing. The caballero stood up and
threw aside his sodden cloak, picked up guitar and
sword and pistol, and left the camp to hurry in the
direction of the mission orchard.</p>

<p>It was so dark he could see nothing, and he could
not locate a path. Roots half washed from the ground
tripped him, water flowed down the back of his neck.
On and on he stumbled, until he ran against the orchard
wall. He managed to get over it, carrying his property,
and searched for a place where the trees would shield
him partially from the storm.</p>

<p>He came to a giant palm and crept close to the bole
where the wind drove the rain against him, but where
it was not quite so bad as in the open. And there the
caballero stood, hour after hour, gradually getting
colder and more miserable, hugging his guitar under
one arm and his sword under the other.</p>

<p>Dawn came, a grey dawn that made the world look
dismal. He left the semi-protection of the palm, went
over the wall, and hurried back to his camp. His horse
was standing with back to the tempest, his head hanging
low, his tail tucked between his legs. Water was
pouring down the slope; the dry grass he had gathered
was drenched; the little creek was a roaring torrent
rushing down the valley toward the sea.</p>

<p>The caballero was cold, hungry, miserable. Across
the plaza he could see smoke pouring from the chimneys,
and to his nostrils came the odour of food being
prepared. The mission bells rang. Neophytes left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
their huts to hurry toward the chapel. Señor Lopez
came from the storehouse and went to the guest house,
carrying a huge umbrella made from skins, and there
Anita Fernandez and Señora Vallejo joined him and
walked across the plaza to the church beneath the
protecting parasol. A fray was placing stepping stones
in the mud before the chapel door.</p>

<p>“I must have a fire!” the caballero remarked, to
nobody in particular.</p>

<p>He walked some distance up the swollen creek, until
he came to a ledge of rock, and there he found some dry
grass; but there was no possibility, of course, of using
the glass-button again, since the sun was not shining.
He collected a quantity of the grass and fired into it
with his pistol, but no spark caught. Again and again
he fired, without success, finally ceasing in disgust.</p>

<p>He went back and stood near the horse, looking up
at the heavens. The clouds were black, ominous; there
was no decrease in the volume of water that poured
from the sky. There was no place near where he could
make a dry camp. And it was fire he needed—fire at
which to warm himself and dry his clothing and cook
another rabbit, if he could kill it.</p>

<p>For the remainder of his life he remembered that day
and the two following. Such misery he never had
known before, nor knew afterward. Now he crept
into the wet orchard; now he braved the open on the
slope. At times he ran back and forth beside the raging
creek, trying to warm his blood by the exertion. Men
and women of San Diego de Alcalá went about their
business, but none gave him attention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>Each hour seemed a day and each day a lifetime.
His clothing was soaked, his boots covered with muddy
clay. He stood beside the horse and looked at the
mission buildings and at the smoke pouring from the
chimneys until he could bear to look no longer. Once
he heard a child laugh, and the laugh plunged him into
the depths of despair.</p>

<p>He rattled the coins in his purse. Worthless they
were here in San Diego de Alcalá; and he would have
traded them all for five minutes of bright sunshine.</p>

<p>He began to grow desperate. Playing the game as
the men and women of the mission played it, they could
not recognise his presence; so he decided to walk boldly
into the storehouse, to warm and dry himself there,
ignoring them as they ignored him. He would take
what food he desired, and throw money in payment for
it down on the counter, and walk out. They would
have to recognise him to prevent it.</p>

<p>The caballero laughed wildly as he reached this
decision and started up the slope toward the plaza. He
reached the door of the storehouse and tried the latch,
but the door was locked, for Señor Lopez had seen
his approach. He tried a window, and found that
locked also. He went to the guest house, to find the
door fastened there.</p>

<p>For a moment he considered raiding one of the
Indian huts, sword in hand, but his pride came to him
then; and he walked back down the slope, his face
flushed with shame because of what he already had
done. He would last it out, he determined! If he died
of the cold and misery, then he would die, but he would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
fight the battle alone without any help from those of
the mission.</p>

<p>And then he remembered the presidio.</p>

<p>Fool, not to have thought of it before! He laughed
again, this time in relief, as he put saddle and bridle
on his horse, and then, waving his hand in derision
at the group of mission buildings, he galloped toward
the bay. There was the presidio only six miles away,
where a caballero could get food and wine and have
companionship while he dried his clothes before the
roaring fire!</p>

<p>He rode like the wind along the highway, facing
the storm as it blew in from the sea, his horse running
gladly, plunging down wet embankments, splashing
through the mud, wading streams where there had been
no water twenty-four hours before. Up the road
toward the structure on the crest of the knoll, the
caballero forced his steed. Before the gate stood a
sentry with a musket on his arm. The sound of
laughter came from the barracks-room, and it carried
cheer to the caballero’s heart. Smoke poured from the
chimney, the odour of cooking meat was in the damp
air.</p>

<p>The sentry’s musket came up and his challenge rang
out. Through the gate the caballero could see an
officer standing in the door of the nearest building.</p>

<p>“Your business?” the sentry demanded.</p>

<p>“Take me to your commanding officer! Call an
Indian to care for my horse!”</p>

<p>The sentry’s cry was answered. A corporal came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
running across the enclosure, an Indian at his heels.
They stopped short when they saw the caballero; the
Indian looked frightened, the corporal grinned.</p>

<p>“Well?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I want to see your commanding officer,” the
caballero said. “I have had enough rain without waiting
here for you to make up your mind.”</p>

<p>“Dismount and follow me,” the corporal said.</p>

<p>The Indian went forward and took the horse by the
bit. A muddy and bedraggled caballero got stiffly out
of the wet saddle and paced through the sticky clay to
the door of the barracks-room. The officer was still
standing there; he had scarcely moved.</p>

<p>“I want food, wine, a chance to dry my clothing
and get warm,” the caballero said. “There seems to
be a superabundance of rain just now at San Diego
de Alcalá.”</p>

<p>“Did you ask hospitality at the mission?” the lieutenant
wanted to know.</p>

<p>The caballero’s face flushed as he met the other’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Your manner,” he replied, “tells me you know of
my reception at the mission. I did not look for the
same sort of reception here. I have a pass from his
excellency that should command respect.”</p>

<p>The caballero handed over the pass, which was wet,
and the officer glanced over it.</p>

<p>“The pass is regular, caballero,” he said, “except
that it does not name you. It cannot, therefore, have
weight with me.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you will not extend the
ordinary hospitality of the road?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“In a few words I can tell you where this presidio
stands regarding yourself,” the lieutenant answered.
“Your recent boast concerning an estimable young
lady is well known, Captain Fly-by-Night. Also is
your general reputation. Soldiers, ordinarily, welcome
a man of your ilk, if he is merry and given to gambling,
even if he cheats with the cards. But Señorita Anita
Fernandez stands in the relation of daughter of our
company, <i>señor</i>. Not a man of the post who would
not die for her. And when the priests and people
of the mission decide you are beneath their notice,
we of the presidio stand with them, even though in
other matters the mission and the presidio are as far
apart as north and south.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, caballero. In regard to the pass—so far
as I know, it may have been stolen. I’ll stand any
consequences that may come from refusing to honour
it.”</p>

<p>They faced each other while a man could have
counted ten, the eyes of neither flinching, hands
clenched, breath coming in quick gasps, each waiting
for the other to make the first move. Like lightning
the caballero’s mind acted then.</p>

<p>He looked into the future and into the past, considering
things of which the lieutenant did not know.
And in that instant of time he decided that it would
be the honourable thing to accept a slight now for
the good that might come from it later.</p>

<p>“You refuse me hospitality?” he asked again.</p>

<p>“I do, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“There may come a time when I shall call you to
account for it, officer.”</p>

<p>“You cannot taunt me into a quarrel, caballero. It
was expected that such would be your method when
you found yourself ostracized, and it was agreed that
none would accommodate you. An officer of standing,
moreover, does not fight with an adventurer who lives
by his wits and his ability to insult women and swindle
men.”</p>

<p>The caballero choked in sudden rage and his hand
went toward the hilt of his sword. But thoughts of
the future came to him again, and he took a step
backward and swept off his sombrero in a stately bow.</p>

<p>“For the time being, it shall be as you say, officer,”
he said. “But do not doubt that there will be a reckoning,
and when it comes I shall take the matter into my
own hands, not hand you over to court-martial for
ignoring his excellency’s pass.”</p>

<p>He turned his back and started toward the gate.</p>

<p>“A moment, caballero,” the lieutenant called.
“While we have decided not to hold intercourse with
you in a social way, it does not follow that you are
entirely ignored. There are alert eyes about you, <i>señor</i>.
And treason has a merited reward!”</p>

<p>“May I ask your meaning?”</p>

<p>“Leave a picketed horse long enough, <i>señor</i>, and
he’ll throw himself with his own rope. I trust my
meaning is clear?”</p>

<p>“As clear as the sky at present, <i>señor</i>,” the caballero
replied. “I shall recommend to his excellency, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
next I greet him, that he place an officer with brains at
San Diego de Alcalá!”</p>

<p>He sprang to the saddle and spurred the horse
cruelly. Back along the road toward the mission he
urged the animal at utmost speed, careless of the treacherous
ground and of what a stumble might mean. Once
more he reached the slope before the mission, and
picketed the horse. He stacked the saddle and bridle
together, got his guitar from a corner by the orchard
wall and put it with them, and covered all with his
cloak. Then he started up the slope, walking swiftly.</p>

<p>He had but a remnant of his pride left and did not
think it necessary under the circumstances to conserve
that. He went around the end of the wall and splashed
across the plaza, scarcely looking at the neophytes and
frailes. Straight to the church he went, opened the
door, and entered. He made his way to the chapel.
There was sanctuary; there none could molest him
without special order; and here he stubbornly decided
to remain.</p>

<p>But there was no warmth, no food, no drink. A
couple of candles glowed. A padre knelt. Two neophytes
were at work patching a hole in the wall. The
caballero paced back and forth in the narrow aisle,
listening to the beating of the storm outside, wondering
whether a fray would speak to him and offer relief.</p>

<p>The neophytes went out, and in time the padre
followed. The caballero did not speak as he passed,
for he felt that the other would not answer. He
wondered whether the entire world had turned against
him. He contrasted his present condition with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
hospitality he had received at Santa Barbara and San
Fernando, and in the adobe house of Gonzales at Reina
de Los Angeles. He longed for the companionship of
the aged Indian at San Luis Rey de Francia, for his
poor hut and coarse food and hard bunk.</p>

<p>And then his pride returned to him in a surge. He
would seek sanctuary in no chapel where his presence
was not welcomed by all!</p>

<p>Out into the rain he went again, across the plaza,
down the slope to where he had picketed his horse.
Back and forth he ran to warm his blood. The sky
darkened, the night came. He saw the lights in the
buildings again, and the odours of cooking food almost
drove him frantic. In the guest house, someone was
singing. He guessed that it was Señorita Anita
Fernandez.</p>

<p>He spent that night in the orchard under the big
palm, shivering because of the cold and his wet clothes,
miserable because of his hunger, and when the dawn
came, and the storm had not abated, he went back
to the horse with an armful of dry grass he had found
in the corner by the orchard wall.</p>

<p>Bravado came to him now. He took the guitar
from beneath his cloak, and, standing out on the slope
where all could see, he played and sang at the top of
his voice.</p>

<p>Still it rained, and the creek grew broader, flooding
the highway and threatening the plaza wall. The
caballero sat on the muddy ground, his cloak over his
head, huddled forward, grim, awaiting the end of the
rain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>“The poor man!” observed Señora Vallejo, watching
from a window of the guest house.</p>

<p>“He has brought it upon himself,” Señor Lopez
reminded her. “Had he returned when I warned him
he would have been in comfort somewhere along the
highway long since.”</p>

<p>“If the rain could but wash his soul as it does his
body!” sighed Anita, standing closer to the big fireplace.</p>

<p>“The man will die,” Señora Vallejo said. “His clothing
is soaked, and he cannot build a fire and cook food.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it will teach him a lesson,” Lopez snarled.
“We must watch; he may try to break into the storehouse
to-night.”</p>

<p>“Listen! He is singing again,” Anita called.</p>

<p>“Oh, the man has courage enough!” Lopez said.
“They tell a thousand stories of his daring. The men
at one of the missions were going to whip him down
the highway once, and he sang them out of it. Moreover,
he got them to play at cards, and finally went
down the highway with a drove of mules loaded with
goods he had won.”</p>

<p>“You are certain all the stories are true?” the girl
asked.</p>

<p>“More stories are true than you may be told, <i>señorita</i>.
It is best not to ask too much,” Señora Vallejo put in;
and she frowned a warning at the storekeeper.</p>

<p>They sat down to the evening meal, to a table loaded
with food as if for a feast. The man down on the
slope was still singing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span></p>

<p>“Perhaps he will go away after the storm,” Anita
suggested. “He will be too miserable to remain.”</p>

<p>“And when the story gets up and down El Camino
Real, he will be forced to leave the country,” Lopez
added. “He is the sort of man who cannot stand
ridicule.”</p>

<p>Darkness descended swiftly that night, and down
beside the swollen creek the caballero, now downhearted,
tried to think of some expedient that would
make his lot better. When the lights were burning
brightly in the guest house, he took his guitar and
slipped across the plaza, to stand beneath Anita’s
window again and play and sing. The howling of the
wind almost drowned his voice, and he doubted
whether those inside could hear. Once the giant Pedro
walked within a dozen feet of him, but did not speak,
and the caballero knew that he was being watched.</p>

<p>He crept into the orchard again, and for a time slept
on the wet ground because of his exhaustion, and as
he slept the rain pelted him and water dripped upon him
from the fronds. Awaking to face another dawn, the
third day of the downpour, his face and hands were
tender from the continual washing of the water, and
his hunger had become a pain.</p>

<p>The rain ceased about midday, but the sun did not
come from behind the clouds. Behind a jumble of
rocks half a mile up the valley, the caballero removed
some of his clothes and wrung the water from them
as well as he could before he put them on again. He
scraped the clay from his boots; and searched beneath
the rocks until he found a small quantity of dry grass<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
and sticks, getting them ready for his fire when the
sun should shine.</p>

<p>But the drizzle continued, and the sun did not show
its face. The caballero stood beside the creek and
watched the rushing stream, one arm around the neck
of his horse. Less than a hundred feet away neophytes
were toiling to strengthen the adobe wall where the
water had undermined it, a couple of frailes giving them
orders; but none spoke to the caballero or looked his
way.</p>

<p>Again night came. He sat on a rock at the edge of
the creek, thoroughly miserable, hoping that the sun
would shine on the morrow, that he’d be able to kill
a rabbit for food. He thought he heard someone
splashing through the mud, and looking around, saw a
dark shape approach.</p>

<p>Something struck the ground at his feet, and he saw
the dark shape retreat again. The caballero took a
few steps and picked up a package; he tore away the
wrapper—and found flint and steel!</p>

<p>The caballero chuckled now and hurried to the pile
of dry grass and twigs he had collected. Soon the
welcome blaze sprang up. He threw on more fuel,
stretched his hands to the fire, spread his cloak to dry.
He was too busy now to speculate as to the identity of
his benefactress; for he had guessed that it was a
woman who had befriended him, else a gowned fray,
and he doubted the latter.</p>

<p>The fire roared, and the caballero stood near it, first
facing the blaze and then letting it warm his back, while
the steam poured from his wet clothes. The fire was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
good, but he needed food also—he would have to wait
for morning for that, he supposed.</p>

<p>Another sound of someone slipping on the wet
ground, and the caballero whirled around and looked
up the slope. But there was silence, and he did not
hear the sound again. Once more he faced the fire, and
presently the sound of footsteps came to him, and this
time he did not turn.</p>

<p>The steps stopped, retreated, and he felt sure that he
heard a bit of laughter carried to him on the rushing
wind. He waited an instant, then walked slowly up the
slope toward his horse. He came upon another
package. Hurrying back to the fire, he opened it.
There was a roast leg of mutton, a bottle of wine, cold
cakes of wheat-paste, a tiny package of salt, a jar of
honey!</p>

<p>With the roast leg of mutton in his hands he did
not stop to wonder as to the good samaritan who had
left the package there. He ate until the last of the roast
had been devoured; drank deeply of the invigorating
wine; stored honey and cakes and salt away in his
cloak, and then he sat before the fire thinking the
world considerably better than it had been an hour
before. Now and then he chuckled, and his eyes were
sparkling.</p>

<p>For, when he had gone to pick up the second package,
he had carried a brand from the fire to light his way,
and he had seen footprints in the soft clay.</p>

<p>They had not been made by Señora Vallejo, for he
had noticed three evenings before down by the creek
that the feet of Señora Vallejo were not of the daintiest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
Neither had they been made by some Indian woman
from one of the huts, since those women always wore
moccasins.</p>

<p>They had been made by two tiny shoes with fashionable
heels, such as might have been imported from
Mexico for the daughter of a wealthy rancho owner!</p>

<span class="s8">VISITORS</span></h2>

<p>The fire died down for lack of fuel, until only a
small bed of coals remained to glow like a
great red eye in the black night. There was
no moon. The caballero, warm and dry, had spread
his cloak on the ground and was stretched upon
it, half asleep, listening to the rushing of the creek and
the screeching of the wind that swept up the valley
from the sea.</p>

<p>He sensed the presence of human beings near him,
and without changing his position on the cloak he let
his right hand slip slowly along his side until it gripped
the butt of his pistol. And there he remained, trying
to pierce the black night with his eyes, ears strained
to catch the slightest sound.</p>

<p>His horse snorted in sudden fear; the caballero
gripped the pistol tighter, half minded to spring to his
feet, yet declining to do so for fear it might be some
prowling neophyte attempting to frighten him and
carry a tale back to the huts in the plaza of how the
caballero had been stricken with fear in the night.</p>

<p>“<i>Señor!</i>” The warning hiss seemed to come from
a great distance, borne on the raging wind. He knew
it was an Indian who spoke; and the inflection of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
single word expressed that the speaker was merely
trying to attract his attention, not threatening, not
warning of some imminent peril.</p>

<p>The caballero rolled over slowly and sat up, yawning
behind his hand, like a man displeased at an interruption.
Though every sense was alert, there was nothing
in his manner to indicate to a watcher that he had
been startled or that the unknown voice out of the night
had carried fright to him.</p>

<p>He looked across the bed of coals, and saw nothing.
He glanced at either side, but no leering face came
from the blackness, no dark form slipped toward him,
knife in hand to attack, or finger on lips to caution
silence. The horse snorted again.</p>

<p>“<i>Señor!</i>” Once more the hiss, and it seemed nearer.</p>

<p>“Well?” the caballero demanded, half angrily and
in a questioning tone.</p>

<p>“It is a friend who would aid you.”</p>

<p>A handful of dry grass and leaves remained near
the fire; now the caballero arose slowly, picked up
the fuel and took a quick step toward the glowing
coals.</p>

<p>“Not that, <i>señor</i>!” came the sudden warning.
“Guards about the mission will see!”</p>

<p>The caballero hesitated, not knowing whether to
treat the man in the darkness as friend or foe. Then
he laughed lightly and dropped the grass and leaves.</p>

<p>“Approach, then, so I may see you!” he commanded.</p>

<p>He heard someone slipping through the mud. Gazing
across the bed of coals he saw an Indian face come from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
the darkness, just the bare outline of a face half seen
in the night—thick black hair bound back from the
forehead, two piercing eyes, an aggressive chin. The
Indian stooped so that the reflection from the dying fire
illuminated his features for an instant.</p>

<p>At the point of speaking, the caballero felt his tongue
seem to grow paralyzed. Beside the face of the Indian
another had appeared—and another—another, until six
faces peered at him from the darkness and six Indians
squatted in the mud on the other side of the bed of
coals.</p>

<p>“We have come, <i>señor</i>,” the spokesman said.</p>

<p>“That is plainly to be seen.”</p>

<p>“At first we were not sure, and then word came
to-day by a runner from an old man at San Luis Rey de
Francia, who said he had given you lodging for a night,
and, also, we saw how you were treated by the people
of the mission and the presidio. So we came.”</p>

<p>“And now—?” the caballero asked.</p>

<p>“What is your wish, <i>señor</i>? In a cañon five miles
away there is a comfortable camp, and if you desire
we’ll guide you to it.”</p>

<p>“I am of the opinion I’d much rather remain where
am.”</p>

<p>“We do not understand your ways, <i>señor</i>, yet we
trust you. If it is your desire to remain here beneath
the mission walls, undoubtedly you have some good
reason. But you must have a camp, <i>señor</i>—shelter and
food and drink—and those of the mission will give
you none.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“You speak truth there,” the caballero admitted.</p>

<p>“Thinking, perhaps, you may decide to remain near
the mission, we carried with us material for your camp.
We can pitch it for you beside the creek in a very short
time, <i>señor</i>. When the dawn comes, those of the
mission will find Captain Fly-by-Night in a comfortable
teepee, with skins for his bed, an abundance of
food and wine, cooking vessels, a heap of fuel. Every
night one of us will fetch fresh meat and other food,
and hear what you may have to say in the way of
orders.”</p>

<p>“This kindness will be the death of me,” said the
caballero.</p>

<p>“We cannot do too much for Captain Fly-by-Night.
We may build your camp?”</p>

<p>“I always accept what Heaven provides. On the
level spot half a hundred feet from the creek would
be an acceptable place.”</p>

<p>The six Indians bowed before him and merged into
the darkness. Chuckling to himself, the caballero sank
back on his cloak and listened, but he did not release
his grip on the butt of his pistol. Sounds came to him
through the night from a short distance away—muttering
voices, flapping skins, the squashing of wet
moccasins in the mud. Half an hour passed, and then
he heard the voice of the spokesman again:</p>

<p>“<i>Señor.</i>”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“The camp is prepared; everything is ready. It is
best that we slip away before being heard or seen. At
midnight each night some one of us will visit you,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
<i>señor</i>, and bring provisions. And now—is there anything
you would command this night?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. You have done well, it seems.”</p>

<p>“You will be guarded, <i>señor</i>. There are friends of
Captain Fly-by-Night inside the mission walls, but they
must move carefully.”</p>

<p>“I should think so.”</p>

<p>“Everything is in the teepee, even to food for your
horse. The fire is laid before it, and you have but to
strike flint and steel. <i>Adios, señor.</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Adios!</i>”</p>

<p>The Indian’s face disappeared again, the caballero
heard the slipping steps retreating, another fragment of
language, and then silence except for the rushing wind
and the roaring creek.</p>

<p>For half an hour he waited, smiling, fumbling at his
pistol, listening, and then he got up and stepped away
from the bed of coals to be swallowed up in the darkness.
He was taking no chances with the unknown,
however. Step by step, and silently, he made a wide
circle and approached the teepee. Standing beside it
he listened intently, but heard nothing.</p>

<p>Before the crude habitation was a heap of dry grass
and wood, as the Indian had said. He sent sparks
flying among the fuel, fanned them to a blaze, and
waited back in the darkness a few minutes longer.
Then he hurried forward and threw back the skins from
the door of the teepee.</p>

<p>The work had been well done. Boughs were on the
ground, skins spread upon them. In a corner was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
jug of wine, another of water, a quarter of mutton, a
quantity of wheat-paste. Two rabbits, skinned and
cleaned and spread on forked sticks, were beside the
mutton. A dirty, ragged blanket, folded, was against
the wall.</p>

<p>There was no fear of treachery in the heart of the
caballero now. As quickly as possible he got his cloak,
sword and guitar, and carried them into the teepee; he
found grain and hay where the Indians had left them—near
the fire—and carried a generous amount to his
horse. Then he returned to the teepee, threw himself
upon the blanket facing the fire, and slept.</p>

<p>Slept—and awoke to find the bright sun beating
down upon his face, that the creek had fallen until it
was scarcely more than its normal size, that neophytes
and frailes were at work again repairing the base of
the abode wall, and that now and then one of them
looked with wonder at the teepee that had been pitched
during the night.</p>

<p>“Curiosity will do them good,” the caballero mused.</p>

<p>It was a royal meal he prepared that bright morning.
Steaks of mutton, one of the rabbits he broiled over a
bed of coals, cakes of wheat-paste were made, and,
sitting out where all could see, the caballero ate his
fill and washed down the food with wine so rich and
rare that he knew no Indian had taken it from his own
store. It was good mission wine such as no Indian
possessed unless he had purloined it in a raid.</p>

<p>He stretched a skin and poured half the water on it
for the horse, for that in the creek was not yet fit for
drinking. He gave the animal another measure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
grain and wiped his coat smooth with a skin, and
polished the silver on saddle and bridle, singing as he
worked so that his voice carried to the plaza.</p>

<p>At an early hour he observed a neophyte ride away
in the direction of the presidio, to return within a short
time with the <i>comandante</i>. In the plaza the officer held
a consultation with a fray, looking often at the teepee
down by the creek, and then the man in uniform
stalked down the slope, swaggering and twirling his
moustache. The caballero arose as the other approached.</p>

<p>“It appears that you have a habitation, Captain Fly-by-Night,”
the lieutenant said.</p>

<p>“As a temporary refuge, it will do.”</p>

<p>“The manner of your getting it is mysterious, to
say the least. Teepees do not sprout overnight from
the mud.”</p>

<p>“Yet it came during the night, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“From whom?”</p>

<p>“That is a question concerning myself, officer.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it concerns others at San Diego de Alcalá.
The frailes at the mission seem to know naught of it.”</p>

<p>“There are many things the frailes of the mission
do not know,” the caballero replied. “There are things,
also, unknown to the soldiers of the presidio.”</p>

<p>“You are over bold to say it, <i>señor</i>. Is your hand
so strong that you can throw secrecy and pretence
aside?”</p>

<p>“When you speak of secrecy and pretence, officer,
I do not know your meaning. It is my own business
how I acquired a habitation and food. I am a man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
of resource, <i>señor</i>. And are you not afraid that you’ll
be ostracized if you are observed speaking to me?”</p>

<p>“It is a part of my business to investigate suspicious
characters,” the lieutenant said.</p>

<p>“Have a care, officer! The score I hold against you
already is a heavy one!”</p>

<p>“Your presence here, and your manifest determination
to remain, are annoying, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“Were you at your post at the presidio, it would not
annoy you, allow me to say.”</p>

<p>“Those of the mission——”</p>

<p>“I have been given to understand, <i>señor</i>,” the caballero
interrupted, “that I do not exist for those at the
mission. As for yourself, if you seek hospitality I have
none to offer you. Suppose you give me the pleasure
of your absence.”</p>

<p>“<i>Señor!</i>”</p>

<p>“<i>Señor!</i>” the caballero mocked, sweeping sombrero
from his head and bowing low.</p>

<p>The <i>comandante</i> snarled in sudden rage and his blade
leaped half from its scabbard. Taking a step backward,
the caballero put hand to hilt again, and waited.
Thus they faced each other beside the creek, while
frailes and neophytes watched from the wall, expecting
the two men to clash. But the rage died from the
officer’s face, and he snapped his sword back in place
again.</p>

<p>“You are a clever rogue, Captain Fly-by-Night,” he
said. “Almost you taunted me to combat. An officer
of his excellency’s forces cannot stoop to fight with such
as you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>“You fear such a thing, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“<i>Señor!</i>” the officer cried.</p>

<p>He looked for a moment at the smiling face of the
caballero, ground his teeth in his rage, whirled upon
his heel, and strode away up the slope, anger in the very
swing of his body. Before the teepee the caballero
picked up guitar and began to play and sing.</p>

<p>Mud flew from beneath the hoofs of the <i>comandante’s</i>
horse as he galloped back toward the presidio. Frailes
and neophytes resumed their work. Two hours
passed—and then there appeared two soldiers, mounted,
who stopped at the plaza, spoke to the frailes, handed
their horses over to Indians, and strolled down toward
the creek.</p>

<p>They did not approach near the teepee, nor did they
seemingly give the caballero more than a passing glance.
Yet he knew that he was to be under surveillance, that
he would be watched by these men night and day, others
from the presidio relieving them from time to time.
And he expected guests at midnight!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII"><span class="tall-2">CHAPTER VII<br></span>

<span class="s8">TWO TALKS, AND A TUNNEL</span></h2>

<p>The siesta hour was over; the caballero had
spent it in proper fashion in his teepee; and
now, standing out in the open, he was feeding
tufts of hay to his horse and caressing the animal’s
neck and nose.</p>

<p>Half a hundred yards away the two soldiers from
the presidio regarded him with animosity, holding him
to blame for their assignment at the mission, where
none had love for them, and their absence from the
barracks-room and its wine and cards, tales and
laughter.</p>

<p>Neophytes and frailes had finished their work of
repairing the adobe wall; men were grouped about the
plaza; children played about the huts of tule and straw;
the door of the storehouse was open and Señor Lopez
stood in it talking to Pedro, the giant neophyte apparently
in the service of the guest house.</p>

<p>Though it appeared so, yet it was not bravado that
drove the caballero to cross the plaza then. It was
necessity; for he had given his horse the water that
remained in the jug, and needed more, and remembered
that there was a well in the orchard.</p>

<p>Swinging the jug by one hand, he started briskly up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
the slope toward the wall, realising that one of the
soldiers was following him at a distance, and that the
other remained behind to watch the teepee.</p>

<p>An Indian lounging beside the chapel called to
another, and the word was passed along. Señor Lopez
straightened up and observed the caballero’s advance;
Pedro followed him inside, and the door was closed.
Indian women called their children into the huts; the
men remained standing in groups, but closer together,
and as they talked they watched the caballero from
beneath shaggy brows. Frailes went about their
business as if he did not exist.</p>

<p>“It is a pleasant thing,” he mused, “to be treated
in this manner by human beings.”</p>

<p>He did not betray what he felt, however. Singing
under his breath as he walked around the end of the
wall, he started diagonally across the plaza, looking
neither to right nor left. Neophytes turned their backs
upon him, and as he passed within half a dozen feet of
a fray, and called a greeting in a cheery tone, the
Franciscan did not answer, did not even lift his head.</p>

<p>He came to the wall around the orchard and swung
upon it—and there stopped, poised, facing the unexpected.
Señorita Anita Fernandez, Señora Vallejo
and a neophyte were walking toward the well.</p>

<p>It was not a time for hesitation, however. He
sprang down on the inside and started forward,
whistling, knowing they were aware of his approach
and that the girl was whispering warnings to her
<i>duenna</i>. The neophyte had filled a water jug and would
have turned back, but the girl instructed him to wait,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
and remained standing near the well, looking down the
valley toward the bay. Her face was flaming, her
black eyes snapped.</p>

<p>“Pardon, <i>señorita</i>,” the caballero said. “Perhaps it
may look badly to you, but I give you my word of
honour I did not see you enter the orchard and purposely
follow you here, even though your <i>duenna</i> is
present. I am of a family that observes the conventions,
<i>señorita</i>, no matter what may be said of me.”</p>

<p>“Señora Vallejo, when will you cease mumbling to
yourself?” the girl demanded.</p>

<p>“I? Mumbling? ’Tis but a frog croaking in the
well.”</p>

<p>“That comes from sleeping on the wet ground,” the
caballero observed. “When last we met my voice
resembled the sighing of the gentle wind through the
olive trees, if memory serves me right.”</p>

<p>Señora Vallejo had turned her back, but the caballero
could see that her shoulders were shaking, and not
with anger. Señorita Anita was deeply interested in
the distant flashing of sun on the water.</p>

<p>“Even such rain as we have had recently could not
drown my ardour,” the caballero continued. “Yet it
was growing almost unbearable—the storm and the
cold and misery. How can I ever find thanks enough
to give the angel who fetched me flint and steel under
cover of the darkness, when I had about given up
hope?”</p>

<p>The girl whirled suddenly, suspiciously, looking not
at the caballero, but at her <i>duenna</i>; and Señora Vallejo’s
face resembled the sunset.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>“Nor is that all,” went on the caballero. “Flint and
steel might have given me fire, but naught but an angel
could have furnished me, at that moment, with cold
meat and wine and other supplies.”</p>

<p>Now Señora Vallejo whirled in her turn, and
Señorita Anita turned suddenly to look down the valley
again, her face flaming red. A choking sound came
from her throat.</p>

<p>“Some fray of San Diego de Alcalá must have been
a holy man, since angels make dwelling here,” the man
said. “For two visited me last night within the space
of half an hour and left material evidences of their
visits behind. It is true I had other visitors later, who
left me even a teepee, but scarcely would I call them
angels, knowing their breed as I do.”</p>

<p>Sombrero in hand, he waited, hoping the girl would
speak to him, if even in rebuke. There was silence
for a moment, during which the two women did not
look at each other, and the neophyte wondered whether
he should call for aid.</p>

<p>“Señora Vallejo,” said the girl, presently, “do you
not think we should be returning to the guest house?
The evening air is cold, and I would not contract a
cough, since I must be at my best when Rojerio Rocha
comes.”</p>

<p>“It would be the proper thing to do; the orchard is
wet.”</p>

<p>“And I always did dislike a croaking frog,” Anita
added. “Tell that Indian to throw out the water in
his jar. Nobody except a senseless being would draw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
water from the well now, since the storm has filled it
with the surface flood.”</p>

<p>The caballero felt his face growing red as he glanced
down at the jug he held in his hand. The girl had
scored again. He looked up quickly, hearing them
start to move away, and for an instant their eyes met
squarely.</p>

<p>“Bullet nor arrow can harm me now!” he exclaimed.
“My heart already is pierced!” And, with that last
shot, he turned toward the curb of the well, put his
jug down upon it, and stood with his back turned
toward them, laughing to himself.</p>

<p>He heard the girl gasp in exasperation, and exchange
whispered sentences with her <i>duenna</i>. There was a step
on the ground at his back, but not for the world would
he turn.</p>

<p>“<i>Señor</i>,” a soft voice said.</p>

<p>He turned now, and swept his sombrero from his
head again, and bowed low before her. Her face was
still flaming, but she looked him bravely in the eyes.</p>

<p>“<i>Señorita?</i>”</p>

<p>“I feel that I must speak to you this once, <i>señor</i>.
For the boasts you made concerning me, I forgive you
freely, believing that they would not have been made
unless you were in your cups. But surely you must
realise that nothing can be accomplished by remaining
at San Diego de Alcalá. The people dislike you, <i>señor</i>,
and your presence is very annoying because of that.
Will you not go back up El Camino Real?”</p>

<p>“That you forgive anything I may have said pleases
me, <i>señorita</i>,” the caballero replied. “It shows you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
have a gentle heart, as was shown last night when you
carried me food. I am desolated to think you have such
an ill opinion of me. As for leaving San Diego de
Alcalá—I cannot think of that just now, <i>señorita</i>.”</p>

<p>“Not even if I ask it as a kindness, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“Not even though you ask it, <i>señorita</i>—and I would
do it for you sooner than for anyone else I know.”</p>

<p>“It is not pretty compliments I wish, <i>señor</i>. Will you
not forget your foolish boast, and go?”</p>

<p>“If ever I made a boast, <i>señorita</i>, it was not a foolish
one.”</p>

<p>“I urge you again, <i>señor</i>, to go before Rojerio Rocha
comes. He is expected to become my husband, and
when he hears of your boast he may take it upon himself
to do something unpleasant. Will you not do as I
request, since I have disobeyed my <i>duenna’s</i> orders and
lowered myself to speak with you?”</p>

<p>“<i>Lowered</i> yourself, <i>señorita</i>?” Surprise, astonishment,
a bit of pain was in the voice, and the caballero’s
face went white for an instant as his fingers gripped
the rim of his sombrero until it was torn. But quickly
he recovered his composure, and bowed before her
again. “I beg your pardon, <i>señorita</i>. But you mistake.
It would be impossible for you to lower yourself, since
angels are above punishment and accusation; it is myself—or
any other man—who is elevated when you
condescend to take notice of his existence.”</p>

<p>“I—I should not have spoken as I did,” she
stammered.</p>

<p>“You should speak exactly as you desire, <i>señorita</i>—always.
It is your privilege. As for me—it is my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
privilege to remain at San Diego de Alcalá, not in
opposition to your wishes, but because I—I have reason
to remain. And you yourself have made it impossible
for me to leave now.”</p>

<p>“I?”</p>

<p>“There was some question, I believe, of my punishment
at the hands of this Rojerio Rocha if I remained.
That in itself is a very good reason why I should not
depart, <i>señorita</i>. Have you ever heard it said that I
am a coward?”</p>

<p>“I am sure you are not,” she replied, searching his
face. “It takes a brave man to depart in the face of
a charge of cowardice, <i>señor</i>. Will you not show your
courage?”</p>

<p>“The point is well taken,” he observed. “But I
have reason for remaining, though mission and presidio
and neophytes and gentiles turn against me—a twofold
reason, <i>señorita</i>. One part of it concerns that of which,
happily, you know nothing; and the other——”</p>

<p>“Well, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“I have seen you, <i>señorita</i>; I have heard your voice
and looked into your eyes. And I intend to win you for
my wife, else have no wife at all!”</p>

<p>“<i>Señor!</i> You dare?”</p>

<p>“To speak the truth——?”</p>

<p>“I might have known insults would be my pay for
speaking to you!”</p>

<p>“Is it an insult to have a gentleman say that he loves
you above all women he ever has seen, that he loved you
when first he saw you, that he hopes one day to call
you wife?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>“It is an insult coming from such as you, <i>señor</i>!”</p>

<p>“Ah! I beg your pardon! I had forgotten for the
time being my name and station.”</p>

<p>“Captain Fly-by-Night would do well to always remember
those things, especially in the presence of
reputable persons. I forgave you the boast concerning
myself, <i>señor</i>; but I cannot forgive you this latest insult
to my face. Go or remain as you will, your affairs are
no concern of mine longer, <i>señor</i>. Though you starve
on the doorstep of the chapel, I’ll not recognise your
presence!”</p>

<p>Señora Vallejo had been calling in a soft voice for
the past five minutes. Now the girl turned from the
caballero and hurried after her <i>duenna</i>. Leaning
against the curb of the well, he watched her until she
had disappeared through a hole in the wall and across
the plaza.</p>

<p>He laughed softly to himself then, and picked up the
water jug, swinging it foolishly at his side, chagrined
to think he had not remembered that the water in the
well would be ruined for the time being, wondering if
Señorita Anita really thought the jug a mere subterfuge
of his to follow her and seek conversation.</p>

<p>Turning, he looked down into the well. Surface
water was seeping through the rocks of the curb, and
a few feet below the level of the ground a torrent
poured into the hole to splash far below.</p>

<p>“Where is that coming from?” the caballero wondered.</p>

<p>He walked to the other side of the curb and bent
over to look better. Ten feet from the top was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
mouth of a small cavern in the side of the well, and
from this the water was pouring in a stream half a
foot deep and a <i>vara</i> wide.</p>

<p>“Persons do not turn a drain into a well,” he observed,
watching the downpour. “There is something
here that needs to be investigated.”</p>

<p>He glanced around. No other person was in the
small orchard; none was peering at him over the wall.
It was almost dusk. Perhaps the soldier who had
followed him from the teepee was watching through a
crack in the adobe, but he could not be sure.</p>

<p>He picked up the jug and sauntered toward the wall,
stopping where a breach had been made, instead of
springing over in the usual place. The soldier had
turned back, and was standing at one corner of the
plaza talking to a fray, and waiting.</p>

<p>The caballero ran back to the wall again, looked
around quickly, and let himself over the curb. Jutting
rocks gave holds for his feet and hands. He lowered
himself rapidly, until he was at the mouth of the small
cavern.</p>

<p>The volume of water pouring out was not so great
now. The cavern was not a small storage-place for
tallow, as he had half suspected, but a tunnel. Now
the spirit of exploration was on him, and he drew
himself inside. Foot by foot he made his way through
the narrow gorge, splashing in water and mud to his
knees, the water dripping upon him from the dirt roof.</p>

<p>Soon he had gone so far that light from the well
did not penetrate, and now he journeyed slowly, putting
a foot out and feeling around before attempting a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
step, fearing to be plunged into a pit or another well.
He had covered a distance of fifty yards when he came
to a turning, and there he stopped for a moment, hesitating
whether to go on.</p>

<p>Then he heard voices, faintly at first, the voices of
women, and they seemed to come from above. He
heard Señora Vallejo’s deep tones raised in rebuke, the
softer syllables of Señorita Anita Fernandez in justification
of her act. He put out his hand to touch the
wall, and found it dry and warm. The cracking of
burning wood could be heard. The tunnel ended
against a wall of the guest house.</p>

<p>“Some wise old padre did this in the earlier days,”
the caballero observed. “I doubt whether half a dozen
men in the mission know of its existence now.”</p>

<p>But there was another tunnel that branched away
from this, and in a diagonal direction. The caballero
followed it, determined to gather what knowledge he
could. Less than a hundred feet, and he came up
against another wall. There were no sounds here, but
there was a thin streak of light entering at the end.</p>

<p>He crept near the streak of light and applied his
eyes to the crack. The day was dying, and he could
see but dimly, but enough to show that he was looking
into the mortuary chapel of the mission. Here, then,
was another way of escape in case of danger, provided
by the frailes of Serra’s time.</p>

<p>His exploration was at an end now, and he faced
the long, wet return journey through the tunnel to
the well. He shivered at the thought of it, and decided
it should not be made. Again he looked through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
crack; there was no one in the chapel, and, moreover,
the tunnel entrance was in a dark corner. He put his
fingers in the crack and tried to pull. A section of the
wall gave a little. He braced himself against the side
of the tunnel, exerted his strength, and a square of
adobe swung inward.</p>

<p>For a moment he waited, listening, then slipped
into the chapel and swung the section of wall back into
place, even scattering dust along the crack where his
hands had gripped. Walking silently, he made his way
to the main part of the church, meeting no one, arousing
no suspicion. Presently he opened the door and
stepped out into the plaza. He was seen only by
neophytes, and his presence there did not arouse much
curiosity among them, for even Captain Fly-by-Night,
they supposed, attended to his devotions and confessed
his many sins.</p>

<p>At the corner of the plaza he came face to face with
an agitated soldier, who had looked back into the
orchard, missed the caballero, and searched frantically
and without result. The caballero grinned in the man’s
red face, and walked slowly down the slope.</p>

<p>“Now from where, in the name of evil, did that
man come?” the soldier gasped. But he got no answer
then, though he gathered a solution at a later day.</p>

<p>The caballero was building up his fire and preparing
the evening meal when the soldier joined his companion
beside the creek. Two neophytes hurried down
the slope and made camp for the men from the presidio,
building a fire and stretching a shelter of skins, and
giving them food and wine. Darkness came swiftly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
and to those at the mission the two fires beside the
creek looked like the eyes of a giant beast about to
spring on the settlement.</p>

<p>The caballero did not attempt a serenade this night.
He sat before his fire, wondering what would occur at
midnight, when the Indians were to come. The
presence of the soldiers complicated matters. He knew
that at least one of them was watching him, and that, if
he started to move away, one would follow.</p>

<p>The hours passed, slowly it seemed to the caballero.
One by one the lights in the mission buildings disappeared.
The heavy fog obscured the light of the
moon and stars. A cold wind crept up the valley,
and the caballero wrapped his cloak around his
shoulders and sat nearer the fire.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII"><span class="tall-2">CHAPTER VIII<br></span>

<span class="s8">A VICTOR RUNS AWAY</span></h2>

<p>An hour after sunrise an Indian rode a mule
furiously up the valley from the presidio. The
beast was covered with lather and dust, and the
rider appeared half exhausted. His screeching awoke
the sleeping caballero, who went out of the teepee and
looked toward the plaza to note the cause of the
uproar.</p>

<p>Frailes and neophytes crowded around the mule’s
rider and questioned eagerly. Señor Lopez came from
the storehouse to hear the news, and the caballero
could see that his face was illuminated with a smile as
he hurried across to the guest house, where he knocked
on the door.</p>

<p>The door opened and Señora Vallejo appeared, Señorita
Anita Fernandez beside her. Words were passed.
Señora Vallejo turned and clasped the girl in her
arms; the <i>señorita</i> hid her face against the <i>duenna’s</i>
shoulder; Señor Lopez laughed loudly, and a passing
fray raised arms in blessing.</p>

<p>Indian women and children began running about,
busy at nothing in particular. Lopez began giving
wine to any who asked it. Straw was thrown on the
mud near buildings where the sun had not penetrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
enough to turn the wet clay to dust. One by one, men
walked to the end of the wall and gazed down El
Camino Real toward the bay.</p>

<p>“One would think San Diego de Alcalá expected a
visit from His Excellency the Governor!” the caballero
gasped. “Nothing like this transpired when I came
off the highway and graced the mission with my
presence.”</p>

<p>And then, an hour before noon, a dust cloud approached
from the north. It did not stop at the
presidio, this dust cloud, but continued up the valley,
and in time it was dispelled enough for the caballero
to see that the riders were two in number, and that
they were followed by a pack mule compelled to cover
the ground at a gallop.</p>

<p>Neophytes covered the top of the adobe wall to
watch; frailes ran here and there about the plaza calling
orders that were given no attention; and Señor Lopez,
standing in the doorway of the storehouse beside the
giant Pedro, jested loudly as he quaffed wine, but in
words the caballero could not hear. The two soldiers
who had been the caballero’s guards partook of the
excitement, and left the shore of the creek to climb the
slope and join in the enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The riders came nearer; one was a man well dressed,
with his bright-coloured zarape flowing behind him;
the other was an Indian who rode a mule. The red
dust of the highway covered them, but they sat their
saddles like men newly mounted, though it was evident
they had travelled the forty miles from San Luis
Rey de Francia that morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span></p>

<p>And now the neophytes were sending their cries down
the valley:</p>

<p>“Rojerio Rocha! A welcome to Rojerio Rocha!
Welcome to the <i>señorita’s</i> husband-to-be!”</p>

<p>Suddenly the caballero began to give more interest
in the proceeding.</p>

<p>“Rojerio Rocha, eh?” he mused. “The husband-to-be
of Señorita Anita? Upon my soul, this is to be
interesting. I presume I’ll have an interview with the
gentleman before the end of the day. Well, I am
prepared for it. Have at you, Señor Rojerio Rocha!”</p>

<p>He laughed aloud like a man enjoying an excellent
joke, and standing beside the teepee watched the arrival
with wide and glistening eyes.</p>

<p>The riders stopped at the end of the adobe wall in
a cloud of dust, the Indian a short distance in the rear
to handle the pack mule. His master swept sombrero
from head, bowed, and dismounted. Neophytes held
back, but the frailes crowded forward and around him,
and Señor Lopez, making his way through the crowd
like a ship through tossing waves, stalked toward the
new-comer with arms extended and moustaches lifted
by a broad smile.</p>

<p>“A welcome, Rojerio Rocha!” he called. “Welcome
to San Diego de Alcalá! No man is more welcome
than you!”</p>

<p>“I thank you,” the new arrival said. He stood
beside his horse, one arm over the animal’s neck.
Señor Lopez noted that he had broad shoulders and
a high brow, that he was handsome, that his moustache
was curled in the approved fashion and his clothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
bore the stamp of mode. He appeared such a man as
those at San Diego de Alcalá had hoped he would be,
for it was fitting that the co-heir of old Señor Fernandez
should have appearance and dignity.</p>

<p>“How like you his looks, <i>señorita</i>?” Señora Vallejo
asked of the girl, as they stood in the doorway of the
guest house, and the crowd parted for an instant so
they could see.</p>

<p>“Splendidly! If his disposition is as good——”</p>

<p>“Tut! Is he not a Rocha, a distant relative of the
Fernandez family? You can see it in the way he stands
beside his horse. Blood always will tell, dear child.”</p>

<p>The rider’s piercing eyes swept the company, passed
over the heads of those nearest, and rested for a
moment on the girl in the doorway. Señor Lopez
hurled a neophyte out of his way and took a step
forward, while all fell silent and waited for the first
words to fall from the lips of the old <i>señor’s</i> heir.</p>

<p>“It gives me great pleasure, Rojerio Rocha,” Lopez
said, “to welcome you to San Diego de Alcalá. I am
Señor Lopez, and was Señor Fernandez’s manager at
the rancho for many years before he passed away. It
was I who wrote you the letter the <i>señor</i> signed
telling that he wished you to inherit his property, together
with his fair daughter, Anita, and expressing the
hope that you two would find it in your hearts to wed.
So I welcome you to San Diego de Alcalá on behalf
of every man and woman here, and may you be pleased
with your inheritance.”</p>

<p>It was a glorious smile that illuminated the face of
the man addressed. For a moment he looked them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
over again, then extended his hand, and Lopez grasped
it warmly.</p>

<p>“Your welcome overcomes me,” he said. “I had
scarce expected it.”</p>

<p>“You might have known, Rojerio Rocha, that we
would be glad to welcome you,” Lopez replied.</p>

<p>“I was not certain, not knowing the goodness of your
heart. Now, as to my inheritance——?”</p>

<p>“The rancho of many broad acres lies five miles to
the west, <i>señor</i>. Neophytes and gentiles are employed
there, and we have, indeed, a happy family. Since
the old <i>señor</i> died his daughter and <i>duenna</i> and myself
have been residing in the guest house here at the mission
awaiting your coming, but I have gone out every
few days to observe how things are being cared for
on the rancho. You will find storehouses full, <i>señor</i>,
and the flocks and herds doing well, and besides, you
inherit the good will of every man, woman and child
in and around San Diego de Alcalá. And now—the
<i>señorita</i>——”</p>

<p>“To be sure—the <i>señorita</i>!”</p>

<p>He continued smiling as Lopez took him by the arm
and led him through the throng to the door of the
guest house. His eyes met those of Anita as Lopez
introduced them, and the girl’s face flushed. It was
disconcerting for her thus to meet this man for the
first time, knowing he was to be her husband.</p>

<p>She responded to his formal bow, and then would
have taken Señora Vallejo by the arm and led the way
into the guest house, but found it impossible, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
new-comer stepped forward quickly and took her hand
and bent and kissed it.</p>

<p>“In all the length of El Camino Real, <i>señorita</i>,” he
said, “I am sure there is not as much grace and beauty
as I find here and now in this one little spot. The
sight of you is worth a journey of hundreds of miles.”</p>

<p>And then, before she guessed what he intended, he
had bent forward swiftly and pressed a kiss upon her
cheek. The red flamed in her face and throat, and
Señora Vallejo gasped in dismay and Señor Lopez
looked surprised, but the men and women of the
mission cheered.</p>

<p>Up the steps and into the guest house they made
their way, while the caballero, down by the creek,
turned to enter the teepee. The smile was gone from
the caballero’s face now; his eyes were narrowed as
if he were thinking deeply. And so he took stock of
his rival, who had gained the first kiss, although it
was no better than a stolen one.</p>

<p>In the guest house there was a welcoming feast,
because the old <i>señor’s</i> heir was just off the highway
and fatigued, with the new-comer sitting at the head of
the table presiding with as much dignity as old Señor
Fernandez at his rancho ever had.</p>

<p>Señorita Anita was at his right hand, Señora Vallejo
at his left; four frailes sat at table, and Señor Lopez
contented himself with a place at the foot of it, looking
upon the others with a solemn face, like a man bowed
under the heavy responsibilities of a big business. He
was wondering whether the old <i>señor’s</i> heir would
retain him as manager.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>Señora Vallejo yearned for news of San Francisco
de Asis, where once she had been a toast, and was
accommodated with a rambling story of the doings of
persons of quality there. Señor Lopez spoke of the
old branches of the Fernandez and Rocha families,
and thought nothing of it when the subject was changed
adroitly, for he knew that the Rocha branch had fallen
upon evil days the past two generations, and retained
little of their once great fortune, though they retained
their stiff pride.</p>

<p>Anita, now smiling, and laughing at times, watched
the guest keenly, trying to estimate him, and found
herself puzzled. Old wine was opened by one of the
frailes, and she saw the man at the head of the table
drink long and deeply. Little by little his dignity and
poise slipped from him. His laugh became louder and
not so merry, for there was sarcasm in the sound of
it. His jests too, were not strictly in accordance with
good taste.</p>

<p>Señora Vallejo bit her lips and frowned; the face
of Lopez remained inscrutable—for who was he to
question the conduct of the old <i>señor’s</i> heir? But
little Anita Fernandez, excusing herself prettily, arose
and left the table, to go to a window and stand there
looking out across the plaza, with dread in her heart,
a feeling she neither could understand nor explain.</p>

<p>For some time she stood there with her back to the
table, biting her red lips, watching the neophytes going
about their work, and then she heard the others get up,
and turned to see the old <i>señor’s</i> heir stagger toward
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span></p>

<p>“Most beautiful <i>señorita</i>, I am going out with this
Señor Lopez to meet the men of the mission,” he said.
“’Twill be lonesome, nevertheless, until I am again
with you. This evening, <i>señorita</i>, we shall take a walk
in the orchard, with your <i>duenna</i> dodging about our
heels, and at such a time a man may talk of things
other than business.”</p>

<p>He lurched forward as if to kiss her again, but she
avoided him and stepped back to bow.</p>

<p>“<i>Señor</i>,” she said, “I dislike to mar your welcome,
yet there is a thing that should receive attention at
once.”</p>

<p>“And that——?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“Has not Señor Lopez told you of Captain Fly-by-Night
and his boast? The man is here, has been here
for several days, though he is treated as a nothing.”</p>

<p>“Captain Fly-by-Night? Here?”</p>

<p>“He has received a teepee and supplies from gentiles,
and is camped down by the creek. His presence is
an insult to me, <i>señor</i>, but we had decided to do nothing
about the matter until your arrival. In the orchard
last evening he was even bold enough to speak to me,
and his words were words of—love. Shall this be
allowed to pass?”</p>

<p>“He is camped down by the creek, eh?”</p>

<p>“He is, <i>señor</i>,” Lopez put in.</p>

<p>“Captain Fly-by-Night, you said?”</p>

<p>“It is the name he is called.”</p>

<p>“What would you have me do?”</p>

<p>Anita’s face flamed again.</p>

<p>“If it is necessary to tell you that, <i>señor</i>, then I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
disappointed in you,” she said. “Rojerio Rocha should
know how to protect the woman he is expected to make
his wife.”</p>

<p>“I shall interview the <i>señor</i> immediately. The boast
he made is known to me.”</p>

<p>“Allow me to accompany you, <i>señor</i>,” Lopez said.</p>

<p>“Thank you, but this is my private business. I’ll
take my Indian servant, and go at once!”</p>

<p>He spoke as a caballero should speak, and the girl’s
eyes grew brighter; and while the look in his face was
not one of fear, yet it was scarcely one of determination,
and that puzzled her a bit.</p>

<p>He seemed to throw off the effects of the heavy wine
with a shrug of his shoulders as he walked to the door.
Señor Lopez followed him out and called for the
neophyte, and went with them to the end of the adobe
wall. There they spoke for a moment, and then the
guest hurried down the slope toward the teepee, the
Indian at his heels. His hand was on the hilt of his
sword, his head held high, his shoulders thrown back.
Anita and Señora Vallejo watched from the window.</p>

<p>The soldiers had returned to the post beside the
creek, and the caballero watching them from the door
of his teepee, saw them get up and glance toward the
plaza. His own attention thus being attracted in that
direction, he observed the advance of the latest new-comer
to the mission.</p>

<p>He remained sitting on the skin before the doorway
polishing the silver on his saddle, and did not look up
as the other approached. Steps stopped beside him,
there was a chuckle, then a voice:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<p>“By all the good saints! It is Claudio!”</p>

<p>“Even so, <i>señor</i>,” replied the caballero, raising his
head now, and getting slowly upon his feet, “and you
owe me two pieces of gold. That was the wager, I
believe, that you would be at San Diego de Alcalá
before me.”</p>

<p>“So it was, caballero, and here are the coins. Ill
luck attended me, while good fortune attended you.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>“This neophyte who trots at my heels—the same
who served us at the Santa Barbara presidio—had a
brother who possessed a horse, and I purchased it,
also a mule, and got the neophyte for guide. I was not
more than four hours behind you, <i>señor</i>, in starting.”</p>

<p>“But—in arriving——?”</p>

<p>“Things came to pass, <i>señor</i>. At San Fernando I
made the acquaintance of a fray who wined and dined
me so well that I slept overlong, afterward telling me,
while I cursed, that he had done it because he feared
I would kill my horse with riding. Arriving at the
pueblo of Reina de Los Angeles, I made my way
quickly to the inn——”</p>

<p>“Expecting to find me with my throat slit?” asked
the caballero.</p>

<p>“Um! By rare good fortune, for you, it appears
you did not visit the inn. I was somewhat surprised
to hear it. But I felt that my chagrin was appeased
when I met a certain man named Gonzales, a jovial
fellow who insisted in playing host to me, purchasing
wine, and playing cards.”</p>

<p>“And losing?”</p>

<p>“I believe I was the more fortunate in the game.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
Afterward I felt sure this same Gonzales had been
losing his wealth purposely, to delay me on my
journey.”</p>

<p>“Who can tell?” said the caballero.</p>

<p>“I was well received at San Juan Capistrano—then
came the storm. By the good saints, how it did rain!”</p>

<p>“I can swear as to that, <i>señor</i>, having been out in
all of it.”</p>

<p>“I managed to reach San Luis Rey de Francia in
time, and there the storm held me up again. These
things, <i>señor</i>, delayed me so that I could not win my
wager, but even these things would not have caused
me to lose had you spent the night in the inn at Reina
de Los Angeles.”</p>

<p>“I can well imagine that.”</p>

<p>“And now they tell me here at the mission that you
are Captain Fly-by-Night, somewhat of a notorious
personage.”</p>

<p>“So they call me, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“You perhaps heard them hail me as Rojerio Rocha?
I have inherited a great rancho, it seems, and am to
wed a fair <i>señorita</i>.”</p>

<p>“Would it not be better, <i>señor</i>, to leave the lady
out of our conversation?” the caballero asked.</p>

<p>“Perhaps; there are weightier things to be discussed.
It seems, dear Claudio, that your presence here displeases
those of the mission. They tell me you made
certain ill-timed boasts concerning a young lady and
her fortune, and the lady mentions you went as far
as to speak to her of love.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span></p>

<p>“Enough, <i>señor</i>! We are not discussing a lady
here.”</p>

<p>“Let us talk, then, of yourself, Captain Fly-by-Night.
Do you take me for an imbecile? Do you
not fear, playing both hands as you do? Do you not
dread a day of reckoning? Can it be possible you do
not observe that you are caught in a trap? But
enough of that! It is your own affair.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“Even now, I presume, they are watching from the
mission buildings to see how I face you. It is expected
that I’ll run you away, <i>señor</i>, or run you
through.”</p>

<p>“Either will be difficult, I fear.”</p>

<p>“Yet I have my position to maintain, <i>señor</i>, and
must attempt one or the other. It would suit me
better to have you out of the way. If I can accomplish
that myself, I may gain in the estimation of those at
the mission. If I fail, there are friends of mine——”</p>

<p>“Why waste language, <i>señor</i>?” the caballero wanted
to know.</p>

<p>“Will you pack up and leave, then? Will you go
back up El Camino Real and attend to your own
affairs?”</p>

<p>“I must decline, <i>señor</i>. Your own removal from
this vale of tears would please me, understand.”</p>

<p>As he spoke, the caballero threw aside his zarape;
his opponent did likewise. Face to face they stood,
blades out, sleeves turned back, both grim, determined.
The neophyte crouched half a score of feet away,
watching every move the men before him made. Men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
crowded the plaza wall, others came running from the
orchard, frailes knelt in prayer, but none approached
down the slope, for here was a matter to be settled
between two gentlemen without interruption from
another source.</p>

<p>In the window of the guest house, Señorita Anita
Fernandez turned quickly and hid her face on the
ample bosom of Señorita Vallejo, and put fingers in
her ears.</p>

<p>The two men engaged, neither a novice at the art
of battling with a blade, each firm of wrist and quick
of foot and eye. Now the caballero advanced, now he
retreated. The steel hissed and sang and rang aloud.
The minutes passed. Perspiration streamed from the
faces of the combatants; their breaths were expelled
in quick explosions.</p>

<p>“’Tis a pretty battle!” cried Señor Lopez from the
top of the wall. “Have at him, Rojerio Rocha, for
your own honour and your lady’s fair name! Flinch,
dog of a Fly-by-Night! Ah——”</p>

<p>The old <i>señor’s</i> heir began a furious attack, the
caballero fell back step by step. And then the recovery
came! What he had done before was but
clumsy fencing to what the caballero did now. He
had felt out his man, he knew every trick at his command,
he was ready now to put an end to it. His
teeth were sunk into his lips, and his eyes flashed as
he drove his opponent backward.</p>

<p>The neophyte gave a cry of fear and crept along
the ground, fearing for his master’s life. Something
flashed in his hand. The caballero, from the corner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
of his eye, observed it in time. Once his blade went
aside, to tear through the neophyte’s shoulder, and
returned to the engagement in time to ward off a
thrust from the other man.</p>

<p>“Treachery, eh?” the caballero cried, above the ring
of the blades. “Your dog of a neophyte fights for
you, eh? That is the sort of man you are?”</p>

<p>“He did it by no order of mine,” the other gasped.</p>

<p>“I pollute my sword if I touch you with it! But
I find it necessary, <i>señor</i>! Run me away or run me
through, eh? You? Fight, hound! Stand your
ground! Your wrist weakens, eh? Bah! ’Tis not
worth a gentleman’s time to meet you foot to foot!”</p>

<p>Those on the wall were standing now, and some of
them had sprung to the ground. Lopez was growling
beneath his breath. The caballero drove his antagonist
up the slope for a space of ten yards, laughing at
him, taunting him, rebuking him, for the neophyte’s
treachery.</p>

<p>“Do you cry for me to cease?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Never, by the saints——”</p>

<p>“Then——!” His blade bit deep into the other’s
shoulder. The old <i>señor’s</i> heir staggered, clapped a
hand to his sword-arm, whirled and crashed to the
ground. And the caballero, stepping back, ran his
blade thrice into the turf to clean it, wiped it on his
trousers, and returned it to its scabbard. He spurned
the treacherous neophyte with his foot and hurried
back toward his teepee.</p>

<p>He had anticipated what would follow, and he had
scant time. From the plaza wall had come a chorus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
of shrieks and howls. He heard the voice of Señor
Lopez raised in raging anger. Neophytes started down
the slope, some of them running, armed with knives,
clubs and stones, to avenge the downfall of Rojerio
Rocha. The frailes called after them in vain. Half
a hundred strong, urged on by Lopez and led by the
giant Pedro, they rushed toward the teepee beside the
creek.</p>

<p>The caballero had no idea of dying there, beaten by
stones in the hands of Indians. He yet had work to
do, he told himself, and when death did come, he wanted
it more honourable than this—at least a bit more
fashionable.</p>

<p>He picked up saddle and bridle and ran to his horse,
and, putting on the bridle first, whirled to draw a
pistol from his belt. The charge hesitated, stopped.</p>

<p>“Back hounds!” he cried. “At least one of you
will fall if you come on! Who’ll be that unfortunate,
eh? Back!”</p>

<p>He threw the saddle over the horse’s back and
worked furiously to cinch it. The voice of Lopez
roared out again, and once more the neophytes moved
forward. Those behind crowded; their speed increased.
Stones flew through the air.</p>

<p>The crash of the pistol came, and an Indian fell to
screech in fear and pain. The caballero leaped to his
saddle. His spurs raked his horse’s flanks. Straight
at them he dashed, blade out and ready, and as they
scattered to right and left he rode through them,
slashing, and dashed away up the valley toward the
distant cañon, turning in the saddle just before he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
disappeared behind a jumble of rocks to remove his
sombrero and wave it in derision.</p>

<p>“Now I am surely cut off from all reputable
persons,” he said, aloud; and laughed until the cañon
walls sent the echoes of his merriment ringing down
the gorge.</p>

<span class="s8">THE ALARM</span></h2>

<p>Scattering curses along El Camino Real at
every jump of his horse, and caring not whether
he killed the animal he rode, Sergeant Carlos
Cassara rode like a madman.</p>

<p>At San Fernando he gave a bit of information to a
fray; at Reina de Los Angeles he had speech with a
corporal in command of the squad at the guardhouse;
he sent a message to San Gabriel; and he sent a fresh
steed flying over the miles that stretched to San Juan
Capistrano as if the life of a nation depended upon
his ride.</p>

<p>Miles behind him rode Ensign Sanchez and a squad
not expected to maintain the fierce pace endured by the
sergeant, and in their wake they left suspicion and
fear.</p>

<p>At San Juan Capistrano, Cassara exchanged horses
while he spoke in quick, low syllables to the padre.
And then he was away toward the south again, eating
up the miles, taking chances in the darkness on the
rough highway through the hills, glad when the dawn
came so that he could make better speed.</p>

<p>San Luis Rey de Francia loomed ahead of him in
the early morning hours; the bells at the mission were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
ringing; neophytes and frailes were pouring into the
church. Indian children flew from before his horse
as the sergeant dashed up to the door of the padres’
quarters, and called aloud for some man to come.</p>

<p>Again he changed horses, once more he whispered
a few crisp sentences that made the faces of the frailes
grow white, and then he was away to the south again
in a cloud of dust—and behind at San Luis Rey de
Francia he left an old Indian before his hut on the
roadside, who wrinkled his eyes in concentrated thought
until he scarcely could see, and then called a young
man and gave a message to be carried back into the
hills.</p>

<p>Exhausted, hungry, thirsty, covered with dust and
perspiration, his clothing sticking to him, the sergeant
thought only of reaching his destination. At the top
of every hill he looked ahead, always hoping to see
San Diego de Alcalá in the distance. And when he
did see it he gave his horse the spurs and urged the
beast to its greatest speed, and bent low over the
animal’s neck like a racing Indian.</p>

<p>He flew up the highway like the wind, knowing that
his approach would be noticed by the sentry at the
gate of the presidio, and hoping that the <i>comandante</i>
would be at his post and not visiting at a rancho or
talking with a padre at the mission six miles away.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the knoll his horse fell, and Cassara
went over the animal’s head to the ground, but
was upon his feet almost as soon as he struck, and
running toward the gate. The sentry cried a challenge,
but Cassara did not answer. Could not the fool see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
his uniform, he wondered? And then he would have
fallen himself had not the man at the gate thrown
out an arm and caught him.</p>

<p>“Your lieutenant!” he gasped.</p>

<p>A corporal came running at the sentry’s cry; he
aided the soldier to half-carry, half-drag Cassara
toward the barracks-room, in the door of which the
<i>comandante</i> was standing, attracted by the sudden
uproar. Sergeant Cassara had no time now for the
niceties of discipline; his salute was merely the suggestion
of one, and he gripped the lieutenant by the
arm to keep from falling as the corporal let go of him.</p>

<p>“Private information—from the north!” he managed
to gasp.</p>

<p>Cassara was known the length of El Camino Real
as a soldier of strength and hardihood, and to see him
in this state told the <i>comandante</i> that unusual things
were happening. He grasped his inferior around the
waist and helped him to get to a private room, where
the sergeant sank upon a stool and threw his arms on
the table before him to brace himself.</p>

<p>The lieutenant offered a cup of wine and Cassara
tossed it off, trying to gather breath enough to speak.
With a wave of his hand the lieutenant ordered the
other soldiers from the room, then closed the door.</p>

<p>“Now, what is it that brings the famous Sergeant
Cassara to our post like a dying man?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“An uprising—greater than any we have yet known!
It has just been discovered, barely in time.”</p>

<p>“Gentiles, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“And neophytes!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“What? Neophytes, too—against the missions? Or
is it against the presidio only?”</p>

<p>“It is against every white man, woman and child
in every mission, presidio and rancho,” the sergeant
said. “Perhaps even now it is too late to prevent the
success of the thing. It has been planned with diabolical
cunning. Every post will be attacked simultaneously,
every white man slain except a few chosen
frailes and a few renegades.”</p>

<p>“Renegades?”</p>

<p>“The ones who have plotted the thing. This is no
murderous raid planned by a few disgruntled gentiles.
It is the greatest thing we yet have had to endure, I
tell you! Here—I have written orders for you! The
Governor is coming down El Camino Real with a
force. We in the north are prepared and ready, but
here in the south difficulties are expected. Here is
the hotbed of mutiny at present—and here one of their
leaders!”</p>

<p>“Their leader—here?”</p>

<p>“Your orders! You see the first? Get him, dead
or alive, sparing no effort, and promotion is yours!
Get him if you would not have this post wiped off the
face of the earth! Get him—Captain Fly-by-Night!”</p>

<p>“Fly-by-Night!” the <i>comandante</i> exclaimed.</p>

<p>“The smoothest renegade unhung! He is the brains
of the thing! For months he has been at work planning
it, and half that time he was an associate of the
Governor, playing at cards and dice with him, drinking
and eating with him. He even came south recently
with a Governor’s pass in his belt. At Santa Barbara<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
we gave him refreshments, the cur! And when he
won a mule from another traveller and continued his
journey south—in haste he was, mark you!—we were
even pleased to think he had won. May the good
saints let me face him with blade in hand again!”</p>

<p>“Again?”</p>

<p>“I faced the cur once—at Santa Barbara—and he
disarmed me almost with a single pass. But I did not
know him then! Let me face him now, when I know
what he is! ’Tis a clever cur! He fooled a fray at
San Fernando—the fray aided him and detained a
traveller of merit. A good Governor’s man at Reina
de Los Angeles sat up and watched while the scoundrel
slept like a baby. Only at San Juan Capistrano and
south did he meet rebuffs, and then not because any
knew of his perfidy, but because he had seen fit to
insult the name of some rancho girl——”</p>

<p>“Ah!” the <i>comandante</i> cried. “There will be promotion
for me in this!”</p>

<p>“Catch him first! You little know your man!”</p>

<p>“Do I not? Did I not refuse him hospitality recently
because of that same insult? Did I not almost
cross blades with him within the past forty hours,
and remembered barely in time that an officer does not
fight with an adventurer?”</p>

<p>“It perhaps were well for the officer you remembered
that,” the sergeant muttered.</p>

<p>“Bah! Captain Fly-by-Night, eh? A boaster and
braggart!”</p>

<p>“Think not that! He is a fighter, that man, as well
as a scoundrel! And you have him here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>“He camps like a fool beside the creek at the mission,
believing himself secure, no doubt, perhaps meeting
his Indian gentiles and doing his plotting almost inside
the mission walls.”</p>

<p>“Get him! Do not let him escape and reach his
Indians, or nothing can stop the attack. The dogs
know their conspiracy is discovered, and may move
sooner than was expected. Those in the north wait
for the attack to begin here at San Diego de Alcalá.
Runners will carry the news, and the raid will flash
up the coast like fire before a gale!”</p>

<p>“It will be an easy matter to get him,” the lieutenant
observed, getting up from his stool.</p>

<p>The beating of horse’s hoofs came to them through
the open window; they heard the sentry’s challenge
and quick steps in the barracks-room, a knock at the
door.</p>

<p>“Enter!” the <i>comandante</i> called, and a corporal hurried
into the room.</p>

<p>“There has been trouble at the mission,” he reported,
standing at salute. “Rojerio Rocha, who is to wed
the Señorita Anita, rebuked this Captain Fly-by-Night
for his conduct, and they fought.”</p>

<p>“The result?”</p>

<p>“Señor Rocha was wounded. The neophytes attacked
Captain Fly-by-Night then, but he mounted
his horse and escaped. He has gone up the cañon.
Rocha demands that he be pursued; some others think
this should not be, since it was a fair duel.”</p>

<p>“Escaped!” Sergeant Cassara cried, getting half up
from the stool. “He will be with his Indians within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
the hour—perhaps he has been warned. He’ll strike
the blow earlier!”</p>

<p>But the lieutenant was already rushing toward the
door.</p>

<p>“Sound the trumpet!” he cried. “Into the hills
after that man! Get him, dead or alive—remember
that! Let only two men remain here at the presidio.
I have kept my hands off the dog because I had no
orders to the contrary—but I have orders now! Here—one
of you give aid to this exhausted sergeant who
brought the news!”</p>

<p>But Sergeant Cassara had no need of aid at that
moment. He had sprawled over the end of the table
as if a man had run him through from behind, his
head pillowed upon his arms, and he was snoring.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X"><span class="tall-2">CHAPTER X<br></span>

<span class="s8">OUTLAWED</span></h2>

<p>The caballero stopped his horse on the crest
of a hill a mile from the mission and looked
back at the valley. For more than an hour
he had been riding aimlessly, aware that it would be
worse than useless to return at the present time and
face the angered neophytes—angered not so much because
of their love for the man he had wounded, since
they never had seen him until this day, as because of
the pain, they thought, his defeat would cause Señorita
Anita Fernandez, whom they had learned to adore.</p>

<p>And now, in the distance, he observed a squad of
horsemen leave the plaza and start out along the road
toward him, and he saw the sun flashing from steel and
knew them for soldiers.</p>

<p>“I did not think it of him—that he would have me
pursued because of a duel,” the caballero said, aloud.
“The thrust could not have been serious. Heaven
knows I have used it many a time, and never death
came from it yet.”</p>

<p>He watched until the horsemen were within half a
mile and then remembered that he sat his steed against
the sky and could be easily seen. He was seen—for
he heard the soldiers’ cries and saw that they were
spurring up their horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span></p>

<p>The caballero did not know this country as the
troopers did, but he made his way down the side of the
hill to the floor of the cañon, where there was a narrow
trail, and along this he galloped swiftly, knowing well
his horse was as fresh and swift as any that followed.</p>

<p>At the end of a mile he stopped to listen, and heard
the beating of horses’ hoofs and the cries of their
riders. He went on along the cañon, hoping he would
not find himself cornered against the side of some steep
hill where there would be no way of escape.</p>

<p>There was a curve in the trail presently, and rocks
prevented him seeing what was beyond, but he did
not slacken his horse’s speed. He took the curve on
a run and emerged into an open space where there was
a tiny stream, a few dwarfed trees, green grass and
wild flowers—an oasis in a desert. Scores of teepees
stood along the brook, heaps of ashes told where fires
had been. The caballero remembered his Indian visitors
had spoken of a camp in the cañon, and supposed
this to be the place.</p>

<p>But no horde of gentiles rushed from the teepees to
accost him and demand his business, and it was apparent
that the camp had been deserted. On the opposite
side of the open space a trail led off toward the
south, and the caballero, without even pulling rein,
rode toward it, determined to follow it until he threw
off pursuit.</p>

<p>His horse splashed across the brook and sprang into
the mouth of the trail, to half whirl with a snort of
fright and start up the side of the rocky hill. Swinging
far out to one side and standing in his stirrups,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
the caballero pulled on the reins and jerked the beast
back into the path—and an Indian grasped the bridle.</p>

<p>“<i>Señor!</i>” he shouted.</p>

<p>“Out of my way! The soldiers pursue!”</p>

<p>“Swing me up behind you, <i>señor</i>. There is a way of
escape!”</p>

<p>“Haste, then!”</p>

<p>The Indian vaulted to the horse’s back; the animal
dashed away up the trail.</p>

<p>“The soldiers will travel slowly, <i>señor</i>, until they
are past the old camp,” the Indian shrieked in his
ear. “They will fear an ambush because you rode
straight up the cañon. Watch to your right for an
arroyo—turn into it!”</p>

<p>There was scant time for speculation with the
troopers at his heels, and the caballero had no reason
for believing the Indian was attempting treachery, especially
since his pursuers were soldiers. He came to
the arroyo and whirled the horse into it, sand and
gravel flying in a cloud behind as he rode. Far in
the rear there was shouting, and a single shot as some
soldier fired his pistol, thinking he saw the quarry.</p>

<p>“On, <i>señor</i>,” the Indian urged.</p>

<p>The horse was having heavy going in the sand with
the double burden on its back, but the caballero urged
the animal to do its utmost. The arroyo ran into
another cañon fringed with stunted trees, and continued
into a sort of basin, where there seemed but the one
way in or out. It looked like a death trap.</p>

<p>The Indian sprang to the ground and ran ahead.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
He parted a clump of brush, and the caballero saw
the mouth of a cave big enough for a horseman to
enter. He did not hesitate when his guide motioned
that he was to ride inside, but he did not ride in—he
dismounted and led the horse, and one hand gripped
the butt of his pistol.</p>

<p>The Indian closed the brush about the entrance and
turned to lead the way, walking a few paces ahead of
the caballero, and soon they were in darkness.</p>

<p>“Follow closely, <i>señor</i>,” he said. “It would not
do to have a light here, but the floor is level and safe.”</p>

<p>Since he was this far, there was nothing else to be
done, so the caballero followed, half expecting to come
to combat at any moment, straining his ears for whispers
ahead or sounds of the pursuit behind. They
reached a large-sized chamber, and the Indian took
him by the hand to guide him across it, and on the
other side they entered a narrow tunnel, made a turning,
and so came to where they could see a streak of
light in the distance.</p>

<p>“It is safe to stop here, <i>señor</i>,” the Indian said.
“The soldiers do not know of this cave beneath the
hill, and, if they found the entrance, they would fear
to enter without torches. At a late hour you can leave
safely. Just ahead is a way out, and it is on the other
side of the hill.”</p>

<p>“So your camp in the cañon is abandoned?” the
caballero asked, sitting on a boulder.</p>

<p>“We slipped away early, <i>señor</i>, a few of us at a
time, not taking the trouble to remove the teepees.
The word has been sent to all, and men are leaving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
every rancheria and village. We obeyed as soon as
we received your message.”</p>

<p>“As soon as you——? Yes, of course!”</p>

<p>“By the middle of to-night nearly all will be on the
Fernandez rancho, <i>señor</i>. Every hut will be crowded,
and there will be a big camp in the cañon there. It
was wise to make the gathering-place there, <i>señor</i>,
where hundreds of men may hide until all is ready.
And from there it is an easy five miles across the hills
to the mission.”</p>

<p>“I understand that.”</p>

<p>“We considered it clever of you, also, to send the
word from San Luis Rey de Francia and in a roundabout
manner. It was well that we were warned that
all had been discovered, and that the big sergeant from
Santa Barbara had come along El Camino Real to put
missions and the presidio on guard.”</p>

<p>The caballero sat up straight and looked keenly at
the face he scarcely could see in the gloom.</p>

<p>“I did not know that,” he said.</p>

<p>“You did not know it? The old man beside the
roadway at San Luis Rey de Francia sent out the
warning. This sergeant told the frailes there that the
conspiracy was known, that the Governor was coming
south with soldiers, and that in the north leaders had
been seized and thrown in prison to be shot. But
Captain Fly-by-Night, the greatest leader of all, was
at San Diego de Alcalá and was to be taken immediately,
before he could join the Indians—that was the
word, <i>señor</i>. Thank Heaven you were not taken!”</p>

<p>“So they have orders to take Captain Fly-by-Night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
eh?” cried the caballero. “Now I know why those
troopers were eager to catch me.”</p>

<p>“What did you think, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“I had an argument at San Diego de Alcalá with
the man they call Rojerio Rocha, who arrived this
morning—a sword argument, gentile—and I ran him
through. I supposed the soldiers sought me because
of that. Catch Captain Fly-by-Night, eh?” The
caballero rose and paced the floor of the cave, laughing
to himself so loudly that the gentile before him cautioned
silence. “So all is known, eh? I am to be
taken dead or alive, I suppose? Now I am, indeed,
cut off from all reputable persons.”</p>

<p>“Then now is the time to strike the blow, <i>señor</i>.
We can be victorious if we strike it before the Governor
comes. We can wipe the mission and presidio from
the earth, <i>señor</i>! We can devastate every rancho!
And when we start, the word will run up the coast,
and at other posts and missions our friends will strike.
We cannot fail, <i>señor</i>! Give the word—give the word
to-night!”</p>

<p>“If I counsel that you wait?”</p>

<p>“Why delay? Other leaders have been seized. If
we do not strike successfully, suspected gentiles and
neophytes will be slain by hundreds by the Governor’s
men. It is all in your hands now, <i>señor</i>. You will be
like a king! Give the word to-night!”</p>

<p>“If I think it best to delay——?”</p>

<p>“I am afraid, <i>señor</i>, that the men will not do as you
order, in that case. They are frightened now. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
know they are lost if they do not strike immediately.
They may even turn against you——”</p>

<p>“Hah!”</p>

<p>“It is to be expected, <i>señor</i>—many of them will pay
forfeit with their lives if the conspiracy is not successful.
Come with me to the rancho as soon as
night falls, <i>señor</i>—and give the word. Every hour we
delay they will be making preparations at the mission
and presidio.”</p>

<p>“At least,” replied the caballero, “I’ll go with you
to the rancho at fall of night.”</p>

<p>The Indian showed his delight in his face. Without
a word he slipped away down the cave toward the
streak of light in the distance, and the caballero stood
beside his horse, listening, waiting, trying to pierce the
gloom with his eyes.</p>

<p>“Dead or alive, eh?” he muttered. “I would I had
slain this pretty gentleman at San Diego de Alcalá when
I had the opportunity!”</p>

<p>It was an hour before the gentile returned—an hour
during which the caballero often led his horse through
the cave to the exit and looked out over the valley,
but dared not leave until he received the Indian’s report.
And then the native slipped in past the rocks and stood
before him.</p>

<p>“I have been over the hill, <i>señor</i>,” he said. “The
soldiers burned the camp in the cañon and then went
back. They have been scattered over the hills, and two
rode away down the valley, probably to spread the
alarm and warn rancho owners to watch for you. It
will soon be dark, and we can leave this cave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span></p>

<p>“The soldiers will remain in the hills for the night?”
the caballero asked.</p>

<p>“They would fear to do that, <i>señor</i>, if they think
we contemplate an attack. They will return to the
mission, perhaps, and spend the night there, and go
into the hills at dawn again. Two men remain at the
presidio with the sergeant who brought the warning, I
heard them say. If we could take the presidio to-night,
<i>señor</i>, and get the arms there——”</p>

<p>“It may be a trap,” the caballero said. “I know the
tricks of the soldiers, remember. It would be better
to be guided by me in these matters.”</p>

<p>The gentile replied nothing, but the expression of
his face told that he was not pleased. For another
hour they remained in the cave, scarcely speaking,
and then the Indian crept to the entrance, remained
there for a time, and returned to say that it was time
to go.</p>

<p>Emerging from the cavern, they made their way
slowly, and as silently as possible, down the slope to
the floor of the cañon, and along this they hurried, the
Indian leading, the caballero walking beside his horse.</p>

<p>Out upon a plain trail that ran to the south the
caballero mounted, with the gentile behind him. At
a trot they went along the trail, stopping now and then
to listen for sounds of other horsemen, the caballero
waiting at every likely ambush until the Indian had
made an investigation.</p>

<p>For a time they followed another arroyo, finally to
come into a broad valley where there were fields of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
grain and horses and cattle. At the crest of the slope
lights glittered in the buildings of the rancho.</p>

<p>But the Indian did not indicate that they were to go
toward the lights. He whispered directions in the
caballero’s ear, and they circled the buildings, and so
came to the bank of a creek flowing from a group of
springs. Down this they made their way to a small
basin. A voice hailed them; the gentile answered; they
went on. And then they turned the base of a hill
and came within sight of two score campfires and
groups of teepees, where half-naked gentiles danced
around the flames, and others squatted on the ground
watching.</p>

<p>In an instant they were surrounded and questions
hurled at them, menacing at first, better-natured when
the caballero’s guide made himself heard and gave the
identity of the man with whom he rode. A young
chief ordered his followers to one side, and himself
took the caballero’s bridle, and led the horse past the
fires to a teepee at the end of the row. There the
caballero dismounted and sat upon a skin spread on
the ground. No word was spoken while a man brought
out food and wine and the caballero ate.</p>

<p>One by one other chiefs made their appearance to sit
before the fire in a circle. In the distance groups of
warriors gathered to look at their leaders and talk in
low tones.</p>

<p>“We have had a messenger, <i>señor</i>,” a chief spoke,
finally. “He came from the mission at nightfall. All
is known to the soldiers, this man says. They have
orders to capture you, dead or alive. The Governor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
is coming south with a large force. Our friends in
the north wait for us to act. And we await the word
from you.”</p>

<p>“You will be guided by me in this matter?” the
caballero asked.</p>

<p>“If you counsel immediate attack, <i>señor</i>. What is
to be gained now by delay? The soldiers from the
north may arrive within three days. If we strike now,
we succeed before they come.”</p>

<p>Grunts of approval came from the others, and the
caballero, looking around the circle, read in the faces
there that the words of the spokesman expressed the
sentiments of all.</p>

<p>“We have considered the matter to-day,” the chief
went on. “Our leaders in the north have been seized.
Of all white men who aided us in forming this plan,
you alone are at liberty. We thank you, <i>señor</i>, for
what you have done. We want to follow you, yet.
But we cannot unless you give the word now. Our
race is strong in itself, <i>señor</i>; often before we have
waited on the words of white men and been betrayed.”</p>

<p>“What is it you want me to do?” the caballero asked.</p>

<p>“Give the word, <i>señor</i>! Our friends at San Luis Rey
de Francia will be ready to strike the blow two nights
from now, and it is proper we strike together. What
say you, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“I counsel longer delay,” the caballero replied.</p>

<p>“Can you give us good reason?” the chief demanded.
“Your words are peculiar to our ears, <i>señor</i>. We had
expected you would be eager to make the move. Many
things have mystified us, and we are suspicious because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
of what has happened before. As I said, we have
considered the matter, and we have reached a decision.”</p>

<p>“What is it, then?”</p>

<p>“Either give us the word now to attack in two
nights’ time, or we attack without your word, <i>señor</i>.
To be certain there will be no treachery we will hold
you prisoner here, but well treated, until the attack
is begun. We do this because of the aid you have
given our cause. And after it is over you shall be
treated with respect, and no man will harm you. Lead
us in two nights’ time, <i>señor</i>, or we strike without
your leadership and keep you prisoner until the work
is done.”</p>

<p>The caballero swept the circle with his eyes; every
man there seemed to approve.</p>

<p>“There are many plans to be made yet,” he said.
“I must counsel delay for a time.”</p>

<p>“We have made all plans while awaiting you, <i>señor</i>.
It is but for you to lead. The plans may be discussed
in half a day’s time, and changed if we decide they
should be. If there is a rancho you wish spared, or a
man or woman saved——”</p>

<p>“Do I not know what is best in this matter?” the
caballero demanded. “Do as I instruct, or I will have
nothing further in common with you!”</p>

<p>“That is your answer, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“It is. I counsel more delay!”</p>

<p>“Then we have decided. You will remain in this
camp until the blow is struck. I regret, <i>señor</i>, that
your ideas are not ours, but we have gone too far to
risk failure. Our friendship for you remains the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
same; it is merely a disagreement between leaders in a
council of war. You will remain in the camp as we ask,
<i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“Suppose I prefer to ride?” said the caballero.</p>

<p>“We cannot take that risk, <i>señor</i>. If you leave,
we must consider you an enemy.”</p>

<p>Another series of grunts came from the circle; again
the caballero read determination in the faces that confronted
him. He got up, and the others did likewise.</p>

<p>“I suppose I may have a teepee, food, picket my
horse?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You shall have every courtesy, <i>señor</i>. This teepee
is yours, food will be furnished, you may picket your
horse behind you.”</p>

<p>“So be it!”</p>

<p>The caballero caught the reins from the Indian who
had been holding them and led the animal to the rear
of the teepee. The chiefs scattered to their own huts;
the men resumed their dancing around the fires. The
caballero threw the reins over his horse’s head and
started to fumble at the cinch of the saddle.</p>

<p>The spokesman turned his head aside for an instant
to look at the dancers, and in that instant, the caballero
vaulted to the horse’s back, shrieked a cry in the
animal’s ear, gathered up reins and applied spurs, and
dashed past the chief and down the arroyo.</p>

<p>Shrieks of surprise and fear rolled from a hundred
throats. The group about the first fire scattered;
the horse kicked the embers in the faces of the gentiles.
Down the line of fires the caballero rode like a madman,
hurling Indians right and left, while behind the chiefs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
realising what he was doing, yelled orders to take him,
screamed for horsemen to go in pursuit, called for
weapons.</p>

<p>Pistols exploded, bullets whistled past him as he
rode. Unscathed he reached the darkness and dashed
down the valley, while the hoofs of hard-ridden ponies
pounded in pursuit. He fired his pistol in the face of
an Indian sentinel who would have sprung at the horse’s
head—and then he rode madly, blindly, trusting to
the sure-footedness of the steed he bestrode.</p>

<p>The animal took the backward track, half maddened
with fear and gunning like the wind. The caballero
bent low over the beast’s neck and let reins fall free.
He did not fear being overtaken, but he did not know
what was ahead. Soldiers sought him—dead or alive.
Indians would slay him without hesitation now, fearful
he would use treachery against them. El Camino
Real was watched. Rancho owners were on the alert
for him. He was an outlaw in truth, and in a strange
country.</p>

<p>Mile after mile he rode, until his horse began to
stagger in its stride, and then, emerging from the
mouth of a cañon he saw lights in the distance and
stopped to reconnoitre. The wash of the sea came
to his ears. The horse had circled the valley—and the
lights ahead were in the presidio.</p>

<p>“Now I <i>am</i> cut off,” quoth the caballero, “from
the society of all persons, both reputable and disreputable!
Riding alone, however, I shall not be
hindered by the opinions of followers. And—by all
the saints!—I have much work to do!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI"><span class="tall-2">CHAPTER XI<br></span>

<span class="s8">AT THE PRESIDIO</span></h2>

<p>Not a light showed in the Indian huts of tide
and straw that clustered near the presidio.
From behind the walls came no whisperings
of conspiracy, no cries of children in their dreams, no
mumblings of women. Since nightfall they had been
slipping away down the coast and back into the hills—the
men to hurry to their camps, women and children
to seek refuge in the wilderness until the war should
be over—exactly as they had done in every uprising
since the coming of Serra and his coadjutors.</p>

<p>Even the mangy curs that generally infested the
road were gone, and so there was none to bark and
snap at the heels of the caballero as he made his way
slowly toward the presidio, walking silently, holding
the scabbard of his sword so it would not strike against
boot or spur, stopping every few yards to peer into
the night, to listen for some sound above the wash of
the sea that would apprise him of the nearness of
danger.</p>

<p>Standing beside the bole of a palm he looked up at
the structure atop the knoll. The gate was closed,
but light came over the wall, and he could hear the
sound of voices raised in argument. Then there came
to his ears the shrieking of an Indian, a raucous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
Spanish voice raised in anger and command, the sound
of a lash striking into bare skin.</p>

<p>He left the tree and crept through the shadows,
avoiding the front, going to the left. Standing against
the wall he listened again.</p>

<p>“Tell us, dog!” Sergeant Cassara was shouting.
“Tell us, or by the saints we’ll have your hide in strips!
Be stubborn before your betters, will you?”</p>

<p>The lash fell again; again the Indian shrieked; coarse
laughter smote the air.</p>

<p>“’Tis well we caught one of you!” the sergeant
was saying now. “Sneak away like the coyotes you
are, will you? Where is that camp—tell us!”</p>

<p>“<i>Señor</i>—<i>señor</i>—I cannot tell!” the Indian screeched.</p>

<p>“Will not, you mean! Cannot, you hound, when
every gentile and neophyte within a score of miles
knows of it? Where have the others gone, then?
Answer me that!”</p>

<p>“One by one they slipped away, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“And you do not know where, eh?”</p>

<p>“I—I cannot tell, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“Will not, you mean?”</p>

<p>“<i>Si señor!</i> I <i>will</i> not!”</p>

<p>The Indian’s voice changed; the caballero listening
by the wall knew what the change meant—stoical
resignation to his fate was upon the red man now;
he expected to be beaten, perhaps slain, and he was
ready.</p>

<p>“Now, by all the saints, this thing passes a jest!”
the sergeant cried. “With the dogs a hundred to one
against us, it is proper we should have all information,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
else soldiers may ride in one direction while gentiles
advance from another and sweep all before them. And
here is a man admitting he knows where the conspirators’
camp lies, and refusing to tell his betters. For
the last time, hound, will you speak?”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you, <i>señor</i>!”</p>

<p>“You realise what is to happen to you if you do not?”</p>

<p>“It is easy to guess <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>The caballero hurried on around the wall until he
came to a small rear gate, used generally to take in
supplies. It, too, was barred on the inside; but it
was studded on the outside with heavy bolts, and the
caballero, using these for footholds and handholds,
made his way laboriously to the top of the wall.</p>

<p>He raised his head carefully, and peered over. All
was darkness in that corner of the enclosure. He pulled
himself up and dropped over, and for an instant
crouched in the shadows against the wall, listening.
But no challenge rang out, and he decided the two
soldiers left behind with Cassara were inside the
barracks-room.</p>

<p>Silently he walked across to the wall of the building,
and silently he followed it until he could peer through
a window. He looked into an officers’ room, but
through the open door he could see the interior of the
barracks-room proper.</p>

<p>An Indian stood in the centre of it, his hands behind
his back, his body tall and straight, his face expressionless.
Before him was Sergeant Cassara with lash
in his hand. The two soldiers sat to one side on stools
before a small table with wine cups before them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>Sergeant Cassara swung the whip through the air,
and the lash curled around the Indian’s body. There
was no shriek this time—the gentile’s eyes closed for
a moment, flickered, then opened wide, and his body
swayed forward a bit as the sergeant jerked the whip
back.</p>

<p>“Speak!” he commanded. “Tell us the whereabouts
of the camp, dog!”</p>

<p>Again the lash was raised. The caballero did not
wait to see the result. He walked on around the
building, and came to the open door. There he took
his pistol from his belt, gripped it for action, stepped
into the path of light, took a quick step—and had entered
the barracks-room and was standing before them.</p>

<p>“Allow me to tell you the location of the camp,
Sergeant Cassara!” he said.</p>

<p>The whip dropped to the floor and the sergeant’s
hand dropped to the hilt of his sword. The two
soldiers had sprung to their feet, but muskets and
pistols were on the other side of the room, and the
muzzle of the caballero’s weapon menaced them.</p>

<p>“Stand as you are!” the caballero ordered. “At
least I will drive the soul of the first man who moves
to eternity. As you are!”</p>

<p>“Captain Fly-by-Night, by all the saints!” Cassara
cried. “Hah! He walks into a trap!”</p>

<p>“Beater of gentiles, he spares you the instant death
you deserved!” answered the caballero. “Move if you
like! This pistol of mine gets one, and, as for the
others——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>“The others, perhaps, when we do move, will live
to see you shot!” Cassara growled.</p>

<p>“Indeed? Careful there, soldier! Your hand may
be itching to grasp a pistol, but there is a sure cure
here for the itch!”</p>

<p>The Indian slipped like a shadow toward a window.</p>

<p>“Stop!” the caballero commanded. “I have need
of you, gentile. You are a brave man to refuse these
soldiers information. See if you are brave enough,
now, to turn them into helpless slaves. There are
thongs in the corner, I perceive. Get them, and fasten
the hands of that nearest soldier behind his back!”</p>

<p>“Now by all——” Cassara began.</p>

<p>“Swear not, sergeant! It amuses me to have this
done. It was information you desired, I believe, and I
am going to give it you, also ask some in return....
Fasten those bonds well, gentile!... I understand,
sergeant, it was you came dashing along El Camino
Real with word that I was to be taken, dead or alive?”</p>

<p>“I had that pleasure, caballero!”</p>

<p>“Um! And by what right——?”</p>

<p>“By right of order from his excellency, caballero.
Your description came down the highway along with
news of the uprising you had planned. Captain Fly-by-Night,
eh? Swindler, gambler, thief! If the
saints spare me and place me before you with naked
blade in my hand——!”</p>

<p>“You had that privilege once, I believe!”</p>

<p>“Hah!”</p>

<p>“And may have it again one day, sergeant....
Gentile, take the second soldier now, and when you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
have bound them, make them sit on their stools, and
tie their legs. We are to have some conversation, and
I cannot watch three men well and talk at the same
time.”</p>

<p>The Indian went about his work gladly, remembering
the many beatings he had received, and groans
from his victims told that he was careful to make the
bonds tight enough. Watching the sergeant as a hawk
watches its prey, never letting the muzzle of his pistol
waver, the caballero stood just inside the door, smiling,
humming a bit of song. In time the two soldiers were
bound to their stools, and the Indian stood to one side.</p>

<p>“Get more thongs, gentile,” the caballero ordered.
“Make them strong for the sergeant here.”</p>

<p>“You dare to order a dog of a gentile to tie me up
like a pig?” Cassara cried.</p>

<p>“I pay you the compliment of considering you too
dangerous to be allowed free, soldier.... At your
work, gentile, and fear not. A move from the man
will send a bullet tumbling into his heart. Lash his
hands well!”</p>

<p>If looks could have killed, the caballero was a dead
man already. Sergeant Cassara’s eyes flamed, his lower
jaw shot out, his face turned purple in rage. But he
made no move while his hands were being fastened
securely, for the caballero was not smiling now, and
the sergeant knew he could expect a shot if he made
a move. But he could talk!</p>

<p>“Caballero,” he said, “for this you shall die! If
ever I am free and stand before you, I’ll have your
life if I am forced to take it with my bare hands!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>“You are bloodthirsty, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“May I live to be the laughing-stock of El Camino
Real if I do not wipe out this insult you have put upon
me!”</p>

<p>“You have orders to take me dead or alive, have
you not?”</p>

<p>“I have, caballero!”</p>

<p>“Do you blame me, then, for having you trussed
up? I value my life, sergeant, and at present I value
my liberty. There are things to be done.”</p>

<p>“And there are things to be undone, thanks to your
treason—things that will cost scores of good lives!”</p>

<p>“Indeed?... Put him on his stool now, gentile,
and see that his great legs are fastened to it....
Careful, sergeant! My trigger finger shakes with
nervousness this night!”</p>

<p>“Your heart will quiver with fear before you die,
caballero.”</p>

<p>“We grow tragic, eh? Now, sergeant, since you
are safe and comfortable, I am at your service in the
matter of granting information. You wished to know
where the hostiles have their camp, I believe? It is
on the Fernandez rancho, sergeant, five miles beyond
the mission.”</p>

<p>“It is likely you speak the truth.”</p>

<p>“However, I am speaking the truth, sergeant. The
camp is where I have said. Gentiles and disloyal
neophytes are gathering there every hour, as they are
gathering near San Luis Rey de Francia and at other
points along the coast.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>“You are bold to say it? And what do you here
with a price on your head, caballero?”</p>

<p>“I came to seize the presidio, sergeant. I have accomplished
that, I believe.”</p>

<p>The sergeant volleyed curses.</p>

<p>“What a soldier you would make, were you a loyal
man!” he said, his outburst over.</p>

<p>“And, since I must dine and sleep, I intend to do it
here,” the caballero went on.</p>

<p>“Hah! Sleep here, will you, caballero?”</p>

<p>“<i>Si</i>, in the presidio, sergeant mine. You think,
perhaps, to get free of your bonds while I sleep, and
capture me in turn? You must indeed have given
little attention to what was transpiring.... Gentile,
fetch wine and food from the rear room!... Why,
sergeant mine, suppose I tell you that the blow has
fallen, eh? Suppose I say that while you played with
this Indian your soldiers have been slain in the hills,
and the mission sacked and burned?</p>

<p>“Suppose I tell you that flame and steel are sweeping
the coast to-night, and that around the wall of this
presidio I have a hundred good men anxious to have
your life and the lives of these two soldiers here?
Suppose I merely had a fancy to capture the three of
you single-handed and have a gentile tie you up? Eh?
Think you I can sleep here to-night in security?”</p>

<p>“Renegade!” the sergeant cried.</p>

<p>“Why not give me thanks for entering alone and
saving your life, instead of letting you be cut to pieces
by hostiles?... Ah, you have the food and wine,
gentile? Place them on the table!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>The caballero put the pistol back in his belt and
drew off his gauntlets, and advanced toward the table,
to draw up a stool and begin devouring the food.
Neither of the soldiers spoke a word; Sergeant Cassara
sputtered meaningless syllables in his wrath.
Slowly, deliberately, the caballero ate his meat and
bread and drank his wine, afterward dipping his hands
into water the gentile fetched, and wiping them on his
zarape.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking,” he said, “of having some
amusement. What do you say, sergeant, to a game
of cards?”</p>

<p>“With Captain Fly-by-Night? Did you ever play
an honest game, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“An abundance of them, sergeant mine. What say
you to a game now? We can make the stakes alluring.”</p>

<p>“I can guess now how you won the mule at Santa
Barbara.”</p>

<p>“Indeed? Perhaps I can propose a more interesting
game now, sergeant.... Gentile, close that door and
bar it!... You are anxious, you say, to stand before
me with naked blade. Let us play, then, and if you
win you’ll have that chance.”</p>

<p>“And, if I do not win——?”</p>

<p>“If you lose, sergeant, you are to walk from this
building, without weapons—and take what comes!”</p>

<p>The sergeant shivered. He visualised a throng of
maniac hostiles crouching against the wall silently,
waiting with eager hands to grasp him. He imagined
tortures and indignities without a chance of resistance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
prior to a terrible death. He knew the caballero was
watching him, yet the picture overcame him, and for
the first time he could not meet another man’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Well?” the caballero asked.</p>

<p>“Make it that I can have a naked blade, at least, and
die fighting as a soldier should, caballero. If you have
good blood in your veins, if ever you rejoiced in the
name of gentleman, grant me this!”</p>

<p>“You are taking the flavour out of our game. I
did not think you would beg favours.”</p>

<p>“Beg favours of you! Then I do not, caballero.
Do as you will with me—I’ll have none of your
game.”</p>

<p>“Yet I must have some amusement before I go to
sleep. Suppose you three soldiers have the game between
you? Dice with death, eh? The two who throw
lowest will be given to the hostiles. The one who
throws highest will receive life and liberty.”</p>

<p>“I live or die with my comrades, caballero! I do not
gamble with them in a matter of life or death!”</p>

<p>“Sergeant Cassara,” said the caballero, “you are a
good soldier and a loyal man.”</p>

<p>He arose and bowed, and walked to the door.
Taking down the bars and motioning for the gentile
to stand there, he went out into the darkness. Near
the wall he listened for a time, but heard nothing.
He was quite sure the remainder of the soldiers would
spend the night at the mission, else in the hills, but
it was best to be certain and not be caught like a rat
in a trap.</p>

<p>Returning to the barracks-room, he closed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
barred the door again, drank another swallow of wine,
and stepped across to the officers’ room.</p>

<p>“I leave you until morning, <i>señores</i>,” he said. “Your
fate will be decided then.... Gentile, attend me!”</p>

<p>And then, followed by the Indian, he entered the
other room and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>“I can trust you?” he asked the gentile.</p>

<p>“To the death, <i>señor</i>. You saved me from a beating.
And are you not Captain Fly-by-Night?”</p>

<p>“Fetch me quill, ink and paper from that shelf. So!
I have a message to write.”</p>

<p>“I am to carry it, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“No. You are to slip outside, climb the wall, and
take station at the corner of it. If you hear horsemen
in the distance you are to warn me at once—you understand?”</p>

<p>“But the others——”</p>

<p>“What others?”</p>

<p>“The hundred men waiting outside, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“Ah! ’Twas a jest at the expense of our sergeant.
There has been no attack yet. And I am here alone.”</p>

<p>“Then you are in grave danger, <i>señor</i>? How does
it happen you are here alone, when the soldiers hope to
capture you? Why are you not at the camp?”</p>

<p>“That is my business, gentile!”</p>

<p>“But the camp—! You have betrayed it! You have
told the true location to these men!”</p>

<p>“Do not let that concern you, gentile.”</p>

<p>“It is, perhaps, a trick to fool them, to draw them
into a trap?”</p>

<p>“Did I not say for you to attend to your own affairs,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
gentile? In a moment I shall be angry. Watch outside,
as I instructed. If any one approaches, warn me
at once. Look in at the window now and then, and be
sure those in the other room do not get free. And
come here to awaken me in three hours’ time.”</p>

<p>“It shall be done, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>The gentile went out; the caballero sat at the table
and wrote his message, and read it, and laughed lightly.</p>

<p>“I risk capture perhaps, but I must get some sleep,”
he told himself. He extinguished the lantern the gentile
had carried from the other room, barred the door, saw
that the window was fastened securely, and stretched
himself on the floor close to the wall.</p>

<p>A pounding on the door awakened him; he sprang
to his feet.</p>

<p>“<i>Señor! Señor!</i>” the voice of the Indian was calling.</p>

<p>“I am here!”</p>

<p>“The time is up, <i>señor</i>!”</p>

<p>“Ah! From the din, I supposed the Governor approached
with a large force!”</p>

<p>It was a yawning caballero who threw open the door
and stepped into the barracks-room to face three wide-awake
soldiers with angry faces. Sergeant Cassara
was mumbling curses under his breath again, and
tugging at his bonds. The caballero smiled at him
pleasantly as he advanced to the table and took the
wine cup the gentile had filled.</p>

<p>“It desolates me to leave such good company,” he
said, “but duty calls. Have you been worrying these
past few hours, sergeant, that the hostiles outside the
wall would enter and tear you limb from limb?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose you will hand us over to them, renegade!
Be a man for once! Release but one of my arms, give
me a sword and let me face you!”</p>

<p>“The Governor has need of your sword-arm, I
believe. As for the hostiles waiting outside, sergeant—please
to remember that I said ‘suppose’ when I spoke
of them. I am a truthful man and would not be considered
otherwise. If you have felt fear, then I am
sorry, for there was no cause. This gentile here is
perhaps the only one within half a score of miles at
present.”</p>

<p>“Hah!” the sergeant cried.</p>

<p>“If it was a subterfuge, consider that it was necessary,
for I was forced to have food and sleep, and you
had orders to take me dead or alive.... Gentile, go
outside and watch!... And you, sergeant, attend me
closely. The blow has not fallen yet; I said ‘suppose’
when speaking of that, too. What I told you about
the location of the Indians’ camp is true. Pass the
word along. And pass the word also that the hostiles
will attack night after next, both here and at San Luis
Rey de Francia. Attend me! By the saints, I speak
truth! It is a warning I have brought you at risk of
losing liberty.”</p>

<p>“What mean you?” Cassara cried. “You, Captain
Fly-by-Night, giving information like this? Ah! You
are a double traitor, eh? The hostiles have disowned
you? You hope to gain pardon from the Governor by
aiding us now to overthrow the conspiracy you have
created?”</p>

<p>“Who can tell?” the caballero replied, smiling and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
drawing on his gauntlets. “There may come a time
when many things will be explained. <i>Adios</i>, sergeant!
Give my compliments to His Excellency the Governor.
Ah, yes! I have written a message!”</p>

<p>He spread out the paper and tucked one corner of
it in the sergeant’s belt, and for an instant fumbled with
the man’s bonds, so that they could be loosened in time
by hard work. Then he waved a hand in salute and
passed out into the night.</p>

<p>“Gentile,” he said, as the Indian opened the gate for
him, “you may come with me to where I left my horse.
You have done more to-night than you imagine, and
while you perhaps are a bloodthirsty wretch not worth
consideration, yet I’ll repay your kindness with another.
I give you this advice—start now toward the south,
make good speed, and do not stop until San Diego de
Alcalá is but an elusive memory far in the back of your
mind. By doing that you may live long and prosper.
If you do not understand, I cannot help it, and I have no
time now to teach you understanding. I must ride far
before dawn.”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Back at the presidio, Sergeant Cassara threw aside
the thongs, and tore the paper from his belt. The
written words stared up at him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To the man known as the <i>comandante</i>: At the
mission there is a man known as Rojerio Rocha, whom
it would profit to watch. This is but a bit of advice
given freely by the man known as Captain Fly-by-Night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII"><span class="tall-2">CHAPTER XII<br></span>

<span class="s8">A TRAGEDY</span></h2>

<p>Señor Lopez turned from the window of the
guest house and threw wide his arms in a gesture
meant to indicate that there was a finality to his
statement that would brook no reply.</p>

<p>“It is madness, Rojerio Rocha!” he exclaimed. “You
are a wounded man!”</p>

<p>“Wounded? A scratch in the shoulder! My
neophyte servant lost twice the blood, and he is as active
as ever this morning. Would you have me show less
endurance than an Indian cur?”</p>

<p>“You do not realise the state of the times, <i>señor</i>.
You heard what the <i>comandante</i> said yesterday when
he passed this way in pursuit of the odious Captain
Fly-by-Night? ‘’Tis a widespread revolt,’ he said,
‘and may break out at any time. This Fly-by-Night
heads it. He is here to see the culmination of his
plans.’ Would that you had run him through!”</p>

<p>“I would that I had, <i>señor</i>!”</p>

<p>“In the shadows of our mission walls he has met his
gentiles and conspired, no doubt. We do not know
which of the natives here at the mission are corrupted
and which are loyal. Now that his conspiracy is known
and he has been driven to the hills, he may gather his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
horde of savages and attack at any time. So I say it
would be madness, Rojerio Rocha, for you to go to the
rancho this morning.”</p>

<p>The younger man stopped pacing the room and stood
before the fireplace in an attitude of determination.</p>

<p>“Rumours of Indian uprisings are as thick as buds
on a pepper-tree,” he said. “The rancho is only five
miles from the mission. Señorita Anita and Señora
Vallejo can ride in a carreta while we ride horses. I am
anxious to see the rancho of which I have inherited the
half. Things may be going to ruin there.”</p>

<p>“Of course, there are the soldiers—” Lopez began.</p>

<p>“Let some of them accompany us. They are looking
for this Captain Fly-by-Night, and they are as like to
find him in the neighbourhood of the rancho as elsewhere.
Your Indians will not attack if we have half a
dozen troopers along, and they will not attack in daytime
at any rate. If things do not look as they should
we can return this evening. It is but a journey of
five miles.”</p>

<p>“Your argument is a good one, Rojerio Rocha, but
I still think it would be madness to make the trip.”</p>

<p>“I wish it. I am tired of the mission already. Was
it not the intention for me to take over the rancho immediately
and wed Señorita Anita after a proper
interval? If you hope to be continued in the post of
manager, Señor Lopez, do not begin our acquaintance
by opposing everything I wish.”</p>

<p>Lopez turned away at that and walked to the window
again, although he did not like the tone of this Rojerio
Rocha and imagined there were unpleasant times ahead.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
And now the mild Señora Vallejo crossed the room to
rest a hand on the younger man’s arm.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it would be better, Señor Rocha, to take
the advice of Señor Lopez,” she said, in her soft voice.</p>

<p>“You are a very good woman, <i>señora</i>,” he replied,
“but a poor contributor to a council of men’s intentions.”</p>

<p>The <i>señora</i>, her face flushing, went quickly back to
the fireplace.</p>

<p>“And I do not fancy the trip,” Señorita Anita put
in, with more spirit than Señora Vallejo had shown.
“I think, Señor Rocha——”</p>

<p>He whirled upon her, and she ceased speaking.</p>

<p>“<i>Señorita</i>,” he said, “I am proud to know you, and
allow me to say I am quite sure you were taught not to
interfere in any arrangements the head of the family
might see fit to make.”</p>

<p>“Allow me to say that you are not the head of the
family yet,” the girl returned, half angrily.</p>

<p>“I am, however, half owner of the rancho, I believe,
through your father’s will, and I think you may trust
me, <i>señorita</i>, to handle these affairs.”</p>

<p>“As to that, you have shown no credentials yet,” the
girl burst out.</p>

<p>“Anita!” Señora Vallejo cried.</p>

<p>“Well, he has not!”</p>

<p>“You doubt me?” the young man wished to know.
“I shall show my credentials, prove my name and
station, at the proper time, <i>señorita</i>, but certainly not
here at the mission. I regret we have had this little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
unpleasantness, for I would win your good favour, but
I am firm in my determination to go to the rancho this
morning. Perhaps my wound has made me sensitive.”</p>

<p>The girl crossed the room toward him, all apology,
and when she spoke her voice was softer than it had
been before.</p>

<p>“I ask you to pardon me, Rojerio Rocha,” she said.
“I had forgotten that you were wounded in defence of
my good name. Since I hope to carry out the wishes
of my dear, dead father, I would be friendly with you,
and I hope that true affection comes. And perhaps I
did wrong to voice my opinion in this matter, being but
a girl. It shall be as you wish, <i>señor</i>. We go to the
rancho.”</p>

<p>“Excellent, <i>señorita</i>! Señor Lopez, you will see
that a carreta is prepared? Have saddles and bridles
put on the horses, too, and I’ll send my neophyte to get
his mule. We should start within half an hour.”</p>

<p>Señor Lopez bowed and hurried from the guest
house, trying to keep from showing his anger, giving
orders about the carreta and horses. The wounded
neophyte, who had been waiting outside the door, went
to get his mule, staggering slightly and walking slowly
because of the blood he had lost, but expressing lively
satisfaction in his face. The animal was picketed down
by the creek, and after putting on bridle and saddle the
Indian led it back toward the plaza to wait until the
others should be ready.</p>

<p>And there he heard a quick step behind him, and a
heavy hand descended on his shoulder and grasped it so
that he cried out with the pain as he whirled around.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
His eyes blazed for an instant, and then the fire in them
died out and a look of fear came into his face, and he
shook like a culprit, trembling.</p>

<p>“Ah!” rumbled a deep voice he had reason to dread.
“So we find our runaway neophyte here at San Diego
de Alcalá, eh? You prefer it to the Santa Barbara
presidio, I take it. What have you to say when I
suggest that I fasten you to a post and give you the
beating you deserve?”</p>

<p>The neophyte did not answer, and neither did he
attempt an escape, but his body seemed to shrink and
he could not meet Sergeant Cassara’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Like a thief in the night you ran away!” the sergeant
went on. “Without asking permission you left
Santa Barbara, where you got good food for the little
shiftless work you did, and received a beating only every
day or so to keep you in order. What are you doing
here, dog? It has been guessed by me these many days
that you are disloyal. You would conspire to slay your
betters, eh? Answer me!”</p>

<p>“Par——”</p>

<p>“Do not say it! You must be a pretty rogue with a
heavy conscience to cry for pardon eternally.”</p>

<p>“<i>Señor!</i> You hurt my shoulder!”</p>

<p>“Why do you flinch?”</p>

<p>“There is a sword-thrust through it.”</p>

<p>“And how got you that, cur?”</p>

<p>“Captain Fly-by-Night gave it me yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Never did I expect to call blessings down on the
head of that rogue, but I do so now. And curses also
that his blade did not find your black heart. Ran you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
through, eh? Well, you are not punished enough.
You shall have a beating yet!”</p>

<p>The sergeant started to walk toward the end of the
plaza, not releasing his grip on the Indian’s shoulder,
dragging the unfortunate after him. Other Indians
stopped their work to look, some of them muttering.
A fray hurried toward them. But before he reached
the sergeant’s side to protest Cassara felt his own
shoulder gripped and whirled about with a snarl, letting
go of the neophyte and starting to reach for his sword.</p>

<p>“By what right do you man-handle my servant?”
were the words dinned into his ears.</p>

<p>“Your servant? Ah, ’tis the young gentleman who
lost the mule at Santa Barbara in a game of cards, eh?
You finally reached San Diego de Alcalá, then? And
what mean you about a servant? This Indian dog is a
runaway neophyte from the Santa Barbara presidio, as
you know, having seen him there, and I am about to
render punishment.”</p>

<p>“Runaway he may be, but he also is my servant, and
I’ll thank you to release him.”</p>

<p>“Then you are not in proper company, <i>señor</i>. This
cur, as I happen to know, is disloyal. He may cut
your throat while you sleep and open the gates to a
savage horde. But if you would have him for servant,
take him, and watch and beat him well. There will be
time for me to attend to him later; at present there are
other duties to be performed. Where, may I ask, can
I find a man known as Rojerio Rocha?”</p>

<p>“I am so known, sergeant.”</p>

<p>“Ah! You don’t mind telling your name now, eh?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
This is different than it was at Santa Barbara? So you
are Rojerio Rocha? I have been told it might profit
me to watch you.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” the other demanded
angrily.</p>

<p>“The meaning is not clear to me. I have but received
a warning, <i>señor</i>, and, being a good soldier and these
being turbulent times, I never ignore a warning, no
matter from what source it comes nor whom it concerns.
What is your business here?”</p>

<p>“I still retain the Governor’s pass, sergeant.”</p>

<p>“Captain Fly-by-Night has a Governor’s pass, if it
comes to that, yet he scarcely is a reputable person. I
believe, in passing, that you had the honour of crossing
blades with him yesterday?”</p>

<p>“I did,” said the other, his white face flushing red.</p>

<p>“And the cause of your quarrel?”</p>

<p>“I do not recognise your right to question.”</p>

<p>“Since my <i>comandante</i> is away in the hills chasing
this Fly-by-Night I am ranking officer here and do as
I please, Señor Rocha. I ask the cause of your quarrel
because I would know the extent of enmity between you
and judge as to the value of the hint I have received.”</p>

<p>“You mean I have been denounced by this Fly-by-Night?”</p>

<p>“Precisely, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“Hah! And how did you receive the hint, as you
call it? Is communication open between you and Captain
Fly-by-Night, regarding whom there is an order
to take, dead or alive?”</p>

<p>“There was a way of communication,” the sergeant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
admitted, chewing vigorously at his moustache and his
face flushing in turn.</p>

<p>“I scarcely think you need credit any warning concerning
myself that Fly-by-Night would give. He perhaps
hopes to cause me annoyance. We fought because
of a boast he made regarding a certain young lady.”</p>

<p>“Over a woman, eh? If there is a woman in it I am
inclined to wash my hands of the matter. A saint can
turn liar when there is a woman concerned. You might
inform me, however, to set my mind at rest, regarding
your business here.”</p>

<p>“I have inherited half of the Fernandez rancho, sergeant,
and have come to take possession.”</p>

<p>“The Fernandez rancho!” the sergeant gasped. “It
is there, so this Captain Fly-by-Night has informed me,
that the hostiles are gathering.”</p>

<p>“That is nonsense. I am going out to the rancho
immediately with some ladies, and four soldiers as
guards. Would I make the journey if there was danger,
especially with ladies along?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are well informed,” the sergeant retorted,
“and perhaps, again, you are not.”</p>

<p>“It appears you give considerable weight to the statements
of this Fly-by-Night.”</p>

<p>“There are times when a man is forced to do so,
Señor Rocha,” the sergeant replied, flushing again.
“Does this runaway dog of an Indian go with you?”</p>

<p>“He does, naturally, since he is my servant.”</p>

<p>“You may be walking into a trap. Yourself, four
soldiers and some ladies would be a great catch for the
hostiles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll take care of myself, sergeant, thank you.”</p>

<p>“Um! Since I have a sort of roving commission
at the present time, I think I’ll ride along.”</p>

<p>“I have not asked for your escort, sergeant.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I think I’ll ride along toward the
rancho. Your four soldiers will pay more attention to
discipline with a sergeant along. Besides, I wish to see
this far-famed San Diego country; and, at least, it may
pay me to watch this Indian servant of yours. Yes—I
believe I’ll ride along!”</p>

<p>“You force me to say that you will not be welcome,
sergeant Four soldiers are enough.”</p>

<p>“As to that, I penetrate many places where there is
no welcome. I am not supersensitive, Señor Rocha, and
my feelings cannot be injured easily, I assure you. It
will not be necessary for me to ride beside the carreta
I see you have ready. I can ride ahead, behind, to one
side.”</p>

<p>“This is almost past endurance.”</p>

<p>“You are a wounded man, and of course cannot
endure much,” the sergeant observed, whirling on his
heel and walking toward the other end of the plaza.
Behind him he left a young man with angry face, who
gurgled imprecations.</p>

<p>Señorita Anita came from the guest house now,
dressed for the journey, and Señora Vallejo walked
behind her, still muttering protests against the trip to
the rancho at this time. They got in the carreta, and
it started out along the road up the valley. Two soldiers
rode ahead and two behind.</p>

<p>On one side of the carreta Señor Lopez guided his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
horse and tried not to show his displeasure; on the other
side trotted a young man who talked to the ladies half
the time, and spent the other half glowering at the
mounted sergeant, who galloped about the country far
to one side, now disappearing behind a ledge of rock,
now coming into view at the crest of a hill, but always
near.</p>

<p>Just behind the carreta rode the neophyte, a bundle of
clothing across the mule in front of him. There was
frank fear in his face whenever one of the troopers approached
him, and always he glanced toward his master
as if expecting a signal or command.</p>

<p>The road followed an arroyo for a mile, and then
emerged on a broad, open space where cattle grazed,
thousands of them dotting the pasturage. Sheep were
on the hillsides, and to the left were fields of grain.</p>

<p>“Is it not a splendid inheritance, Señor Rocha?”
Señora Vallejo murmured.</p>

<p>“It is, indeed,” he replied, and he showed no great
amount of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>Señorita Anita frowned. On this rancho she had
been born and reared; here she had played as a child,
and here the frailes from the mission had come to
teach her. In an enclosed space near the ranch-house
her mother was buried, and her father.</p>

<p>She remembered how her father had laboured
through disappointments to triumph to make this a
profitable home; how seeds and bulbs had been imported
that there might be beauty there; how proud he
had been when the flocks and herds grew and new
buildings were erected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>And now here was his half-heir scarcely giving the
place a glance after having manifested such eagerness
to reach it. A little lump came into Señorita Anita’s
throat, and she would not look at the man who rode
beside the carreta, but glanced away toward the distant
hills; and a tear trickled down her cheek.</p>

<p>Now they had reached the top of the slope, and in
the distance the buildings of the rancho could be seen,
white against the green background. To one side were
long, low adobe structures around which many Indians
were gathering.</p>

<p>“Too many of the men are inactive,” Señor Lopez
growled, anxious for the younger man to think he had
the best interests of the rancho at heart. “The overseers
are not firm enough in handling them. At this
time of the day nearly all should be at work in the
fields. It appears that nine-tenths of them are about
the buildings.”</p>

<p>He continued to frown as they neared the ranch-house,
and finally rode ahead at a gallop toward the
adobe structures. The Indians did not make a pretence
of being busy as he approached. Some glowered at
him as he passed, others deliberately turned away as he
would have spoken to them in rebuke. He reined in
his horse before one of the buildings and glared down
at a score of men sitting round the doorway and
stretched on the ground.</p>

<p>“What means this, dogs?” he demanded. “Why are
you not at work?”</p>

<p>Not a voice answered him; some glanced up and
then away again, while others ignored his existence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>“Where are your overseers?” he demanded next.
“Where is Antonio, José? Answer, one of you!”</p>

<p>“We have seen neither this day, <i>señor</i>,” one of the
men replied.</p>

<p>“Do not talk to me with a crooked tongue! Go to
the fields, or I’ll take the whip to you! As for Antonio
and José, we’ll see whether they can drink wine and
waste time while I am away!”</p>

<p>Not an Indian moved to do his bidding. The carreta
had stopped before the ranch-house now, and two of
the soldiers left it to ride toward Lopez, sensing trouble.</p>

<p>“Rojerio Rocha!” Lopez called, but the man he addressed
was assisting Señorita Anita from the carreta,
and did not answer.</p>

<p>“Are the dogs mutinous?” one of the soldiers asked.</p>

<p>“Uncivil beasts, all of them!” Lopez replied. “Get
about your work instantly, animals!”</p>

<p>He rode toward them as if to crush those nearest
beneath the hoofs of his horse. Angry mutterings came
from the throng, and some of the Indians sprang to
their feet menacingly. An old man in the doorway of
the building shouted something Lopez did not understand,
and the mutterings ceased in an instant and the
men scattered, some going toward the fields, others into
the buildings.</p>

<p>Lopez turned to call Rojerio Rocha again, and saw
him disappearing into the house with Señorita Anita
and Señora Vallejo. The other two troopers had dismounted,
the carreta was rumbling away toward the
stables, and the neophyte servant was standing near his
mule looking back along the road, for in the distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
Sergeant Cassara sat his horse and contemplated the
rancho.</p>

<p>Lopez started to ride slowly toward the house, the
two troopers following. Came a scream from a
woman’s throat—then another—a man’s voice raised
in surprise! The two soldiers near the house ran in at
the door. Lopez and the others spurred their mounts
and dashed to the building, there to throw themselves
from their saddles and rush inside.</p>

<p>They heard the troopers ahead of them running into
the patio. A woman was crying hysterically. And
then they reached the patio themselves, to stop beneath
the arched veranda dumbfounded at the scene confronting
them.</p>

<p>Señora Vallejo was standing against the side of the
building, her face hidden in her hands, sobbing violently.
Señorita Anita Fernandez had fainted in Rojerio
Rocha’s arms. And the two troopers stood near the
small fountain in the centre of the patio, where there
were two bodies stretched on the ground. Lopez gave
a cry of consternation as he hurried up to them.</p>

<p>Here were Antonio and José, the two overseers of
the rancho, each sprawled on his face with arms outstretched,
each with the hilt of a knife showing between
his shoulder-blades!</p>

<span class="s8">THE EAVESDROPPER</span></h2>

<p>Watching from the distance, Sergeant Cassara
observed that the Indians of the rancho
were leaving their adobe buildings in groups,
and, instead of going into the fields to work, were
hurrying down the slope toward a cañon.</p>

<p>The neophyte who waited in front of the ranch-house
mounted his mule after a time, and went toward
the cañon himself, urging on his steed as soon as he was
a short distance from the building, until the animal was
running with head down, covering the ground with
great leaps.</p>

<p>Already the sergeant had seen the soldiers and Señor
Lopez run into the ranch-house, and he was contented
no longer to remain a hundred yards away and speculate
as to what was transpiring. Sergeant Cassara was a
man who enjoyed getting all his information at first
hand.</p>

<p>He put spurs to his horse, therefore, and galloped
up the road to the ranch-house, to stop at the corner of
the veranda and sit there on his mount for a moment,
listening. He heard the low whimpering of a woman,
and the excited voices of men, and finally dismounted
and walked around the corner of the house, and so
came to the patio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span></p>

<p>“So! There has been murder done here?” he exclaimed,
after surveying the scene. “Are you all struck
dumb and thoughtless? Why stand like so many statues
and do nothing? By the saints, there seems to be not
an ounce of decision amongst you all! You who call
yourself Rojerio Rocha would do well, it seems to me,
to carry the <i>señorita</i> into the house where she will not
have to face this bloody scene when she comes from her
faint. One of you troopers assist the <i>señora</i>, also.
And you, who are named Lopez, why not start in to
investigate this matter?”</p>

<p>“What can be done?” Lopez asked.</p>

<p>“First, who are the victims?”</p>

<p>“The overseers.”</p>

<p>“They have been beating the Indians, I suppose, and
some have taken revenge while the overseers took their
siesta. A long siesta they are enjoying now! Get the
bodies away, in the saints’ name! Help him, soldiers!
And then it will be time to deal with the gentiles.”</p>

<p>Lopez called for the house servants, but none
answered. There was not an Indian woman near the
place; no children played about the huts in the rear;
and the men, of course, had gone toward the cañon.
Sergeant Cassara stood at the end of the patio and
sneered as Lopez began to realise these things.</p>

<p>“This man who calls himself Rojerio Rocha and
takes such a high hand with affairs evidently was not
well informed as to conditions,” the sergeant suggested.</p>

<p>“I asked him not to come to the rancho to-day,”
Lopez returned, “but he would have it so.”</p>

<p>“He insisted, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>“<i>Si, señor.</i>”</p>

<p>“But why bring the ladies into danger? Do they not
have brains at the mission in these days?”</p>

<p>“He insisted, also, that the ladies make the journey.”</p>

<p>“Ah! He did? Well, the thing that appeals most
to me now is for you to start your carreta back toward
the mission as soon as possible, and make as good time
as you can getting there. The ladies will have to get
over their fright first, of course. I do not like the air
hereabouts—it smells rank of conspiracy and murder.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, <i>señor</i>,” Lopez admitted.</p>

<p>“And while we are waiting for these same ladies to
settle their nerves, why not round up some of these
gentiles and propound a few leading questions? Perhaps
we can beat an answer or two out of the dogs.”</p>

<p>“As soon as Señor Rocha returns from the house,
sergeant. He is master here now, and must supervise
this business. I do not care to make a move without
his permission.”</p>

<p>“You do not, eh? I am an independent being, thank
the good saints! I suggest you prepare the carreta for
the return journey, while I ride after these gentiles I
saw sneaking down into the cañon, and see what can be
discovered. You may follow later if this Señor Rocha
is kind enough to allow you to do so.”</p>

<p>The face of Lopez flushed at the sergeant’s tone, for
Cassara was not careful to refrain from expressing his
contempt for a man who would await the permission of
another in such business. He ran to his horse, sprang
to the saddle and galloped down the slope, leaving Lopez
to glare after him. He did not follow the trail taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
by the Indians, however, but rode far to the right and
circled a butte, and so approached the cañon from the
opposite side, warily, stopping his horse now and then
to listen.</p>

<p>After a time he dismounted and crept forward, dodging
from rock to rock, bush to bush, until he reached
the edge of a precipice and found the floor of the cañon
stretched far below him.</p>

<p>He saw an Indian camp where fully half a thousand
warriors had gathered. They seemed to feel secure
in their strength, for they made no attempt at secrecy
now. Some were dancing about their fires, others were
donning war paint, others guarded a herd of ponies.
The Santa Barbara neophyte was talking to a throng
of them, throwing out his arms in passionate gesture,
and his hearers shrieked their approval.</p>

<p>“This looks like a bad business,” Sergeant Cassara
admitted to himself. “So Fly-by-Night did not tell an
untruth, eh? What object the rogue can have in betraying
his poor dupes is more than I can fathom. To-morrow
night they will attack, he said. I wonder if
that is the truth, too?”</p>

<p>For several minutes he watched the camp, trying to
estimate the number of men there, and to see what they
possessed in the way of weapons, gathering information
that would be of value to the <i>comandante</i>. He got up
from the ground to make his retreat then, and in so
doing glanced across the cañon to the slope beyond.</p>

<p>Señor Lopez and the four troopers were galloping
toward the cañon.</p>

<p>Two ideas flashed through the sergeant’s brain—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
Lopez and the soldiers were riding unexpectedly
into great danger, and that they had left the two women
and Rojerio Rocha alone at the ranch-house.</p>

<p>There was not time for him to reach his horse and
ride to intercept them, to warn them of their danger.
To screech an alarm would avail nothing—it was doubtful
if the others would hear, and if the Indians heard
they would guess someone approached and prepare for
the meeting. It would be worse than useless for him
to charge down the side of the hill, if trouble came, and
attempt to aid the others—such a course would be
suicide in the face of such a throng; and Sergeant
Cassara was a good enough soldier to realise his duty to
his comrades and superiors, to realise that it was for
him to carry an alarm to mission and presidio.</p>

<p>Helpless to warn or aid, he crouched behind the
rocks at the top of the hill and watched the drama unfold
below him. Lopez and the troopers reached the
crest of the hill and dashed down toward the cañon
proper. Cassara saw an Indian sentinel flash a warning
back to the others. A few commands, and the dancing
around the fires stopped, and gentiles crept up the slope,
dodging behind shrubs and rocks, weapons in their
hands.</p>

<p>With Lopez in the lead, the little cavalcade swept
around the end of the butte and into the cañon, into
the midst of a swarm of half-frenzied natives, and
stopped with gentiles grasping at the bridles. Cassara
could hear Lopez shrieking something above the din,
saw the troopers draw sabres, rein back their horses,
and try to clear a space around them. The Indians<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
crowded forward, menacing, screeching their cries,
more and more of them gathering about the five riders,
until only the heads of the mounted men could be seen
above the horde.</p>

<p>Striking with their sabres, the troopers were trying to
clear a space in which to wheel their horses and retreat.
An arrow flew from the side of the hill—a trooper
reeled in his saddle and fell over his horse’s neck, and
a chorus of shrieks arose at this first blood.</p>

<p>The troopers drew their pistols and, firing in the
faces of the savages nearest; several Indians fell; and
then the riders were the centre of a maelstrom of raging,
fighting, bloodthirsty gentiles and neophytes who
fought with one another to pull the troopers from their
horses, to lay hands on the manager of the Fernandez
rancho, a man many of them had reason to hate.</p>

<p>“It is the beginning,” Sergeant Cassara heard himself
muttering.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes for an instant, for it is one thing
to be in the centre of a savage combat and quite another
to view one at close range and yet have no part in it,
and when he opened them again the Indians had
scattered, the five horses were running wild with gentiles
trying to capture them for the loot of silver-chased
saddles they presented, and on the floor of the cañon
were five mutilated things that so short a time before
had been men.</p>

<p>Now the Indians were dancing about their fires again,
this first small victory having added to their frenzy, and
their shrieks could be heard a great distance. Cassara
knew his duty now—to mount and ride, to reach the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
ranch-house and aid in saving the women there, if he
could; to continue to the mission and spread the alarm,
and have those soldiers seeking Captain Fly-by-Night
recalled from the hills before they were cut off one by
one and slaughtered.</p>

<p>He saw the Santa Barbara neophyte mount his mule
again, and heard him shrieking at the others, though he
could not catch the words. He started to slip away,
back from the edge of the precipice to his horse, and as
he got upon his feet he saw another horseman galloping
from the ranch-house toward the cañon.</p>

<p>Loud curses came from the throat of Sergeant Cassara
then, curses at what he considered the man’s foolishness,
for the rider was Rojerio Rocha.</p>

<p>“The fool has left the women alone!” he gasped.
“By all the saints, I’d like to run him through for the
worthless, senseless thing he is! Let them alone in the
ranch-house, he has, and rides toward danger like an
imbecile! Can’t he hear those yells, the fool? Can’t
he tell something is wrong?”</p>

<p>Crashing through the brush, stumbling over the
rocks, Cassara rushed toward his horse and vaulted into
the saddle. His spurs raked the beast’s sides cruelly;
with a snort of pain and surprise the animal ran wildly
around the butte, sending showers of gravel down into
the cañon. The sergeant bent low and gripped the
reins, lifting the horse in its great jumps. On and on
he rode, circling the knoll so as to approach the house
from the opposite side.</p>

<p>He came within view of it—and pulled up his mount
sharply. He was too late. Rojerio Rocha was in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
centre of a horde of shrieking Indians. They did not
pull him from his horse, and they seemed to be making
no effort to attack him. But they had turned the
animal’s head, and fully two hundred of them were
rushing it back toward the houses running alongside,
some mounted on ponies and some afoot. In an instant
Cassara had judged distance. The Indians were within
fifty yards of the adobe buildings, within one hundred
yards of the house. And he was fully three hundred
yards away.</p>

<p>Sergeant Cassara hesitated a moment. He never
knew fear, and was not the sort of man to surrender
another man and two women to a savage band without
making an effort to rescue them, even if it was certain
he would die in the attempt.</p>

<p>But he could not save these people, he knew, and
would only lose his own life. And if he died in the
patio of the ranch-house at the hands of frenzied
gentiles who hated the uniform he wore, there would
be none to carry the alarm to the mission.</p>

<p>And now the throng had reached the house and
rushed into the patio, Rojerio Rocha still mounted on
his horse. A bedlam of shrieks and screams assailed
the sergeant’s ears. He thought of the two women who
had ridden out in the carreta—the dignified <i>señora</i>, the
dimpling <i>señorita</i>—and cursed the man whose obstinacy
had brought them there.</p>

<p>“Torture—and worse!” he exclaimed. “May the
saints see that this Rojerio Rocha suffers thrice for
every bit of pain those women are caused!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span></p>

<p>And then he wheeled his horse, sent home the spurs,
and dashed down the road toward the distant mission.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The <i>comandante</i>, back from his fruitless search of the
hills for Captain Fly-by-Night, saw the flying horse
in the distance, caught the glint of sun from the sergeant’s
sword and called to his soldiers. Frailes ran
to the end of the adobe wall to watch the approaching
horseman.</p>

<p>Less than twenty neophytes remained at the mission
now—all day they had been sneaking away one at a time
and hurrying to the camp on the rancho—and of those
who remained it was a question which were loyal.</p>

<p>“’Tis our famous sergeant from Santa Barbara!”
the <i>comandante</i> cried. “He rides like that because the
matter is urgent, you may be sure.”</p>

<p>The foam-flecked horse stopped at the end of the
wall with forefeet in the air as the sergeant swung himself
backward in the saddle and sprang to the ground.
Even as his feet struck the turf his hand snapped to
his cap in salute. He was breathing heavily, but he was
a soldier of experience, and did not shout his news
aloud like a frightened child.</p>

<p>“Something of moment to report, <i>comandante</i>,” he
said.</p>

<p>The <i>comandante</i> drew himself up and returned the
salute—he was a soldier of experience, too.</p>

<p>“Regarding hostiles?” he asked, while the frailes
hung on his words.</p>

<p>“Regarding hostiles, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“Follow me to the guest house, sergeant; you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
give me your report there. Have one of the men attend
to your horse. Is it of a military nature only, or should
the frailes hear?”</p>

<p>“They can hear it, <i>comandante</i>.”</p>

<p>They crossed the plaza, the lieutenant leading the
way. There was no haste in their manner. If there
were disloyal neophytes about, they would learn nothing
from the way in which these soldiers conducted themselves.
Behind the lieutenant and sergeant walked four
frailes, their heads hanging, sensing what they were to
hear. Another fray remained in the plaza, and every
neophyte there knew he was being watched.</p>

<p>The lieutenant threw open the door of the guest
house, and they entered, and the door was closed again.
The frailes stood against the wall in a row awaiting the
blow they expected. The <i>comandante</i> threw back his
shoulders and took a deep breath, and snapped out his
order:</p>

<p>“Report, sergeant!”</p>

<p>“Five hundred or more hostiles are camped on the
Fernandez rancho. They are dancing and putting on
their paint. I followed when Señor Lopez and Rojerio
Rocha took the women there. Four troopers escorted
them.”</p>

<p>“I am aware of that.”</p>

<p>“Two rancho overseers were found knifed. I made
an investigation and found the hostile camp. Lopez and
the four soldiers rode into the cañon where the camp
is located and were slain——”</p>

<p>“All?”</p>

<p>“All,” said Cassara.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>“The others?”</p>

<p>“Señor Rocha rode toward the cañon as I was starting
to return to the house to make an attempt to rescue
the women. The hostiles seized him and took him
back to the house. Before I could cover the distance
they were in the patio—fully two hundred of them. I
knew it would be useless to attempt a rescue then, so
rode to report.”</p>

<p>“And the women——”</p>

<p>“Were in the house, <i>comandante</i>!” Sergeant Cassara
said.</p>

<p>The frailes groaned and bowed their heads in resignation.
Further explanation was not needed. They
realised the situation fully; such situations had been
met by frailes since the sainted Serra first set foot in
California and began his great work of creating the
mission chain.</p>

<p>“There remains one thing to do, then—prepare for
defence,” the <i>comandante</i> said. “We have twenty
soldiers, eight frailes, about a score of neophytes believed
to be loyal, and half a dozen ranchers who happen
to be in the mission. Ensign Sanchez and his squad
from Santa Barbara should be here in the morning.
The squad is a small one, but every man is a man in
such times. At least, we can put up a pretty battle. If
we can hold out until the Governor arrives”—a pause—“Hah!
Five or more to one, eh? How like you the
odds, sergeant? Frailes, you know your duties, I
believe. If you feel like hesitating in the work of preparing
for carnage, remember those two women!”</p>

<p>But they were fighting priests, those men. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span>
expressions that came into their faces now were not
such as come into the countenances of cowards and
weaklings. Their gowns remained, but beneath them
the priests had been transformed into soldiers in an
instant of time. They passed before the lieutenant and
sergeant, walked to the door, opened it and went out,
each to do what he could in the plan for defence.</p>

<p>The <i>comandante</i> and Sergeant Cassara faced each
other for an instant, like men who understand without
resorting to words, then Sergeant Cassara saluted and
followed the frailes out of the guest house and into the
plaza.</p>

<p>And back of the fireplace, against the guest house
wall in the old tunnel, crouched Captain Fly-by-Night,
who had heard all that had been said; who remembered
a proud, flushed face, a dimple, two snapping black
eyes, a voice so sweet and low that it struck to the heart
like the breath of a song—and who prayed now that the
black night would come quickly!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV"><span class="tall-2">CHAPTER XIV<br></span>

<span class="s8">UNMASKED</span></h2>

<p>It was to Anita’s old room in the house at the rancho
that she was carried after the sight of the two
murdered overseers had caused her to faint.
Señora Vallejo, assisted by one of the troopers,
followed, and when Anita had been put on the bed the
older woman crouched at the foot of it, still weeping
hysterically. The trooper hurried back to the patio.</p>

<p>“Get some of the native women, Rojerio Rocha!”
the <i>señora</i> commanded them, trying to control herself.
“Tell them to bring cool water.”</p>

<p>She went to Anita’s side as the man left the room,
opened the girl’s dress at the throat and began chafing
her hands, meanwhile looking toward the door and
patting the toe of one shoe on the floor because Rojerio
Rocha was so long about his task.</p>

<p>Señorita Anita moaned and opened her eyes, and
Señora Vallejo, clasping her in strong arms, they wept
again together, still terrified by the recollection of what
they had seen, a gruesome sight for which they had not
been prepared.</p>

<p>Then the door was thrown open and Rojerio Rocha
stood before them, his sombrero in his hand.</p>

<p>“Ah! Señorita Anita is herself again?” he said.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
“That is well, indeed, for there is not an Indian
woman about the place, nor a male servant. They have
run away, it seems.”</p>

<p>“Run away?” the two women gasped in unison.</p>

<p>“Nor is that all. All the Indians employed at the
rancho have deserted the buildings and fields and are
hurrying toward the cañon near by. ’Tis a well-ordered
piece of property I have inherited, it appears.”</p>

<p>He laughed and swaggered across the room to a
window, to look down into the patio. The women
were quick to sense some change in his manner, and
again fear gripped their hearts.</p>

<p>“Run away?” Señora Vallejo exclaimed again.
“What does it mean? There is danger—grave danger?
Rojerio Rocha, let us return to the mission immediately.
Ah, if you only had listened and had not come!”</p>

<p>“Enough of that, <i>señora</i>!” he cried, whirling toward
them.</p>

<p>“Have you forgotten your gentle blood, that you
speak in such a tone to a woman?” Anita demanded,
sitting up on the bed.</p>

<p>“There are times when a woman must be brought to
her senses, <i>señorita</i>. Allow me to handle this affair in
my own way. I am going down into the patio now, and
do you both remain in this room until I return. At that
time I may have better information to give.”</p>

<p>He went out without looking at them again, closed
the door behind him, and they heard the bolt shot
into place. Anita sprang to her feet and ran across the
room to try the door before the beating of the man’s
steps had ceased to be heard. It was indeed fastened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>“I am beginning to hate him!” the girl exclaimed.
“It will be difficult, I fear, to do as my father wished.
And I—I am beginning to be afraid. The house is so
quiet. Señora Vallejo, can you hear Indians shrieking
in the distance?”</p>

<p>“I have heard them for some time,” the <i>señora</i> replied.
“We have walked into a trap, I fear.”</p>

<p>“Why do the men not start to return to the mission
immediately? Señor Lopez and the four soldiers
surely can guard us well, and one of them ride ahead
for help if we need it.”</p>

<p>“It may be possible,” said the <i>señora</i>, “that the
Indians have run away merely because they fear punishment
for the killing of their overseers.” But she
said it merely to allay the girl’s fears, not because
she believed it.</p>

<p>There was a clatter of hoofs at the end of the patio,
and the two women hurried across to the window
in time to see Señor Lopez and the four soldiers dash
away. They turned to the right toward the cañon,
and the women could watch them no longer; and so
they stood before the window and looked down into
the patio, awaiting the return, watching Rojerio
Rocha as he paced back and forth beside the fountain,
now fumbling at the hilt of his sword, now pulling
at the pistol in his belt, always with head bent and a
scowl on his handsome face.</p>

<p>In time he stopped at the end of the patio and
shaded his eyes with his hands to look toward the
cañon. A chorus of shrieks and cries came from the
distance. They heard Rojerio Rocha laugh, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
he grasped the reins of his horse, jerked the animal
around and vaulted into the saddle to gallop away.</p>

<p>Clasped in each other’s arms, silent, fearful, the
two women remained standing before the window. An
hour passed that seemed like an age. And then they
heard the cries and shrieks again, doubled now, seemingly
coming nearer—cries and shrieks that the older
woman translated as easily as if they had been spoken
words. Even the girl seemed to recognise a new note
in the bedlam, for she looked up into the older woman’s
face wonderingly, questioningly, and she felt Señora
Vallejo’s arms tighten about her.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“The blood cry—I know it well.”</p>

<p>“And it means——”</p>

<p>“It means that the fiends have had blood, that there
has been murder done.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes! The overseers.”</p>

<p>“I did not mean the overseers,” Señora Vallejo
said, turning her face away and looking out of the
window.</p>

<p>“You mean that Señor Lopez—the soldiers—Señor
Rocha——”</p>

<p>“Some of them, perhaps all. We shall know soon.”</p>

<p>The girl moaned and hid her face against the older
woman’s shoulder and tried to shut out the cries by
putting fingers in her ears. But she could not shut
them out, and in time ceased to try.</p>

<p>“They are approaching,” Señora Vallejo said.</p>

<p>“Coming here?”</p>

<p>“Here or else to the adobe buildings. And we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
not a weapon in the room, nor any man to protect us.
The door is locked—we cannot escape and attempt
to hide.”</p>

<p>“Oh, why did he lock it?” the girl cried.</p>

<p>The end of the building shut off the view as they
looked from the window. But they knew the horde
was approaching, and rapidly, and with the blood
shrieks were mingled other cries the meaning of which
Señora Vallejo could not understand at first.</p>

<p>“They are acclaiming someone,” she said, finally.
“Some chief who has performed a murderous assault,
I suppose. May the saints curse the man whose
treason agitated them!”</p>

<p>Then she grasped the girl and drew back from the
window quickly, letting the draperies that hung there
fall back into place. An Indian had appeared at the
end of the patio—a tall, young Indian streaked with
war paint and with a musket in his hand. They
watched as he glanced around the enclosure, then
slipped like a snake past the fountain to the door to
listen there. Finally he whirled around and ran to
the end of the patio again, to wave his musket and
shriek at the others.</p>

<p>Then, like a wave breaking on a rocky beach, the
horde poured into the patio—dancing, shrieking,
screeching—charging across the veranda, splashing
through the water of the fountain, tearing at the palms
old Señor Fernandez himself had planted and tended
until they were grown.</p>

<p>And, in their midst, sitting his horse with shoulders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
squared, his face devoid of all expression, was the man
Señor Fernandez had said his daughter was to marry.</p>

<p>“They have brought him here to kill him!” the girl
moaned. “And, the others——?”</p>

<p>“Dead, else ridden for help,” replied the <i>señora</i>.
“If we had but a poniard——”</p>

<p>The horse had stopped beside the fountain. A
chief grasped the animal’s mane and was shouting to
the maniacs who shrieked around him. They stopped
their dancing and their cries died down. Half a
dozen men raised hands to take the rider from his
horse and carry him toward the door, half a dozen
more led the animal from the patio, scores ran toward
the adobe buildings, and others gathered in groups
in the enclosure to hold animated conversation, now
and then screeching their enthusiasm and shaking
muskets and bows above their heads.</p>

<p>Señora Vallejo drew the girl back from the curtained
window, and they stood at the foot of the bed,
still clasped in each other’s arms, looking toward the
door. They heard steps in the corridor outside—the
steps of but one man, it seemed—and they feared
a skulking gentile reconnoitering, one who soon would
send a shriek ringing through the house to inform
the others he had found women there.</p>

<p>Silence for an instant, then they heard the bolt
withdrawn. Another instant, and the door was
thrown open.</p>

<p>“Rojerio Rocha!” Señora Vallejo exclaimed.</p>

<p>He closed the door behind him, bowed before them,
and advanced a step into the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span></p>

<p>“You have come to say that there is no hope?”
the woman asked.</p>

<p>“I have come to say, first of all, <i>señora</i>, and you,
<i>señorita</i>, that there is absolutely no danger for either
of you, if you are obedient.”</p>

<p>“No danger? What mean you, Rojerio Rocha?
No danger with that mob of howling savages in war
paint, crowding the patio and overrunning the house?”</p>

<p>“They are not overrunning the house, <i>señora</i>, pardon
me. None are in the house except chiefs and a
few servants. Already they have the fires going, and
a roast of beef is being prepared. You shall have
food soon.”</p>

<p>“Are you an imbecile in truth?” the <i>señora</i> cried.
“You trust such wretches? Do you not know that, if
they do not slay us at once, they are but playing with
us as a cat plays with a mouse before she kills it?
Where are your brains, Rojerio Rocha? Is there to
be no attempt at rescue? Give us at least a poniard,
that we may protect ourselves or take our own lives
to save honour! Where is Señor Lopez? Where are
the troopers? Have they ridden for help?”</p>

<p>She stopped speaking, standing before him with her
hands clutching at her breasts—fear-stricken, desperate,
but angry above all.</p>

<p>“Señor Lopez and the four troopers,” he replied,
“rode down into the cañon to make an investigation,
disregarding my orders to the contrary. They are
dead.”</p>

<p>“Dead?” Anita cried.</p>

<p>“Dead, <i>señorita</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>“But you——? Why have they let you live, Rojerio
Rocha? They will torture?”</p>

<p>“I already have informed you that no harm shall
come to you if you are obedient.”</p>

<p>“And, to be obedient——?”</p>

<p>“Is to remain in this room, <i>señorita</i>, and you, <i>señora</i>,
until you are told you may depart elsewhere. Food
will be fetched you regularly; you may have anything
you wish. Be not afraid of the Indians in the patio
and surrounding the house. They are not a menace—they
are here for protection.”</p>

<p>“Protection?” sneered the <i>señora</i>.</p>

<p>“Your protection—and yours, <i>señorita</i>—and mine.”</p>

<p>“Yours?” the women cried.</p>

<p>“What mean you?” the <i>señora</i> demanded, as an
afterthought.</p>

<p>“That these Indians call me master. Do you understand?
That I am their commanding officer. That
the time to drop the mask has come, <i>señora</i>, and you
may consider the mask dropped. To-night and to-morrow
we prepare; to-morrow night we take the
mission and presidio. After that the other things will
follow—every rancho and village will be visited.”</p>

<p>“You—you——!” Anita gasped.</p>

<p>“You will get used to the idea, <i>señorita</i>. Within
half a score of days I shall be a king. You did not
think to wed the ruler of the coast, did you, <i>señorita</i>?
Why did you think I am so anxious to come to the
rancho to-day? Because my armies had been gathering
here, <i>señorita</i>, and because it was my place here,
instead of at the mission. And I desire to get you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
here, with the <i>señora</i>, where you will be out of harm’s
way until after we have succeeded. As for Lopez
and the troopers—they walked into the trap, and we
have five men the less to fight to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>He laughed loudly and took another step toward
them, and the women recoiled.</p>

<p>“You realise—what you are saying?” the <i>señora</i>
gasped.</p>

<p>“Fully, <i>señora</i>.”</p>

<p>“You—Rojerio Rocha—with the blood of the
Rochas and the Fernandez in your veins—you turn
renegade, lead hostile Indians, play at treason, countenance
murder and rapine? Fear has turned your
brain! You could not do such a thing!”</p>

<p>“It takes a man with good brain to do it, and
travel on the Governor’s pass at the same time,” he
returned, laughing again. “Rest assured I speak the
truth, <i>señora</i>. It has taken much planning, but soon
we see the culmination.”</p>

<p>“But—this Captain Fly-by-Night——?”</p>

<p>The man’s face darkened.</p>

<p>“A meddling fool,” he said, “who shall be sent to
eternity if ever I cross blades with him again. A
nothing, a novice—this man of whom you speak!
Captain Fly-by-Night, eh? The fools sent out alarms
concerning him, eh? They chase him and hunt him
like a mad bull—while I am guest at the mission, and
smile, and send out my plans and orders under the
very noses of the frailes. I do not deny this man
has had his uses. But I command—not he!”</p>

<p>The first horror was over now; full realisation was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
coming to the women. Señorita Anita stepped out
to the middle of the room and confronted him, and
she showed no fear now. Her head was lifted proudly,
her breast heaved with emotion, outraged pride and
anger struggled in her face for expression.</p>

<p>“So it was all a farce?” she cried. “You and this
Captain Fly-by-Night were not such deadly enemies
as report had it, eh? Partners in treason you were,
playing your nefarious game! And the duel down by
the creek—how came it he ran you through? Was
that a part of the game, too?”</p>

<p>“We fought because of an argument concerning
Señorita Anita Fernandez, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Traitors fell out, and you would say it was over a
woman? Say, rather, that you both sought leadership—that
there was one general too many! Say,
rather, that even before the culmination of your plans
you fought regarding the division of the loot—myself
being desired by both pretty traitors!”</p>

<p>“Say what you please, <i>señorita</i>, so long as you let
the fact remain that this man of whom you speak
has nothing in common with me. As for yourself—you
please me very much, and I shall claim you when
this more serious business is at an end.”</p>

<p>“Claim me—you? Renegade! Traitor! Take you
for husband? Do you suppose my father knew your
true character when he made his request? He never
had seen you, Rojerio Rocha, but he supposed—because
you had Fernandez and Rocha blood in your
veins—that you were a gentleman and true. Marry
you, Rojerio Rocha? Marry a man the Governor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
calls friend, and who plans to stab his friend from
behind?”</p>

<p>“Marry, or come to me without marriage—as you
wish,” the man said. “Your will against me will not
be so strong, I think, when things are at an end and
I become master.”</p>

<p>“Rather would I wed this Fly-by-Night—this gambler
and swindler and thief and wronger of women—this
man who made immodest boasts concerning me.
And before I’d do that, I’d take my own life, Rojerio
Rocha! Call in your savage friends and let them
torture, and slay me! Never can I hold up my head
again, whether your conspiracy is successful or no!
That a man of my family and blood should do this
thing——! Where is the pride of the Fernandez
now? This stain never can be washed away!”</p>

<p>“A truce as to your foolish pride! Enough of
heroics, <i>señorita</i>, and you, <i>señora</i>! We’ll talk further
of these matters at a later day. At present remember
that I am master here. You will remain in this room,
and food will be fetched. Every comfort you wish
will be furnished. And when things are settled again,
I take you for wife, Señorita Anita, whether you wish
it or not. These Indians will not allow you to escape,
yet they will protect you. Had I left you at the mission,
you might have been injured by mistake during
the fighting. Calm your fears and make the best of
things, and try not to change conditions you cannot
affect. There is no need for fear—already the gentiles
look upon you as their queen.”</p>

<p>“Their queen! I, a Fernandez, queen of savages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
over a kingdom purchased by treason and steeped in
blood? Have I not shame enough with which to contend?
Go—go!”</p>

<p>She turned half from him, sobbing, hands held to
face. Señora Vallejo had collapsed at the foot of the
bed. There was silence for the moment, and then the
man’s laugh rang out—raucous, sneering, malevolent.</p>

<p>“By the saints, you are beautiful when aroused!”
he cried. “These heroics will not outlast the day, I
vow! If I took you in my arms, perhaps——”</p>

<p>She heard his quick step, and turned to confront him.
So they stood for a breath, a foot apart and then the
man laughed and raised his arms.</p>

<p>One of her hands darted forward and then, when
she sprang back to avoid him, she gripped the poniard
he had worn at his belt. Her arm drove it forward.
Her head was half turned away as she felt it strike
his breast. She dropped the weapon and covered her
face with hands again, waiting for the crash that
would tell her his body had fallen to the floor and that
she had slain a man.</p>

<p>But the crash came not, and in its stead there was
a muttered exclamation of surprise, and a chuckle of
relief.</p>

<p>“Your blow was strong and sure, <i>señorita</i>,” he said.
“Fortune favours me in that the point struck on the
buckle of my sword-belt. As for the poniard—I intended
leaving it with you, that you would feel more
secure. I always did fancy a woman of spirit. You
will make a right royal queen for such a warrior as
myself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>“Go—go!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Immediately, though I dislike to leave such good
company; yet there is work to be done and the time
is short. Within a short time an Indian will come
with food, and if there is anything you lack for comfort,
you have but to command.”</p>

<p>He turned his back deliberately and walked to the
door, and she could not nerve herself to pick up the
poniard and strike again. She felt herself reeling
and knew that reaction soon would be upon her. But
she bit her lip cruelly to force herself to gather her scattering
senses, and once more she addressed him.</p>

<p>“Send no Indian with food. I do not eat what
traitors prepare, and neither does my <i>duenna</i>. And
when that door is opened again after you are gone—no
matter by whom—I plunge this dagger into my own
heart, Rojerio Rocha, and so pay in part for the stain
you have put upon our family. I swear that I’ll do
this—and there will be no belt buckle to turn aside
the point!”</p>

<p>His face sobered for an instant, for there was no
mistaking her determination. He threw open the
door and looked back toward her and finally laughed
again.</p>

<p>“<i>Adios, señorita</i>,” he called. “When hunger makes
you forget what you have just said, you may call to
someone in the patio and they will carry me word.”</p>

<p>He went out and closed the door. The girl heard
the bolt shot into place. One moan came from between
her lips, and then she collapsed at the foot of the bed
beside Señora Vallejo.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV"><span class="tall-2">CHAPTER XV<br></span>

<span class="s8">THE WAY IN</span></h2>

<p>An hour after nightfall the well in the orchard
at the mission gave forth a man. Mud and
dust were mingled on his clothes, the ends of
his moustache drooped, and there was a scraggy beard
on his face. The dainty caballero was gone, and in
his place was a warrior of stern visage and flashing
eyes, who stood beside the well curb for a few minutes
listening and then lost no time in crossing the orchard
and climbing the adobe wall.</p>

<p>Once outside, his progress was rapid over the uneven
ground. Now he walked and now he ran, making his
way to the crest of the slope behind the mission buildings.
He turned west and hurried on, making as
little noise as possible, stumbling over rocks and roots
and small brush, for there was no moon and a man
could see scarcely two feet in front of his face.</p>

<p>He came to a small dry watercourse and turned
into it, running continually now through the heavy
sand, less liable to attract attention, but panting from
the exertion. Finally he stopped, listened again and
appeared to be uncertain of his surroundings. A soft
whinny came to his ears, and with a subdued gasp of
thankfulness he ran on.</p>

<p>Beneath a ledge of rock in a natural cup in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span>
earth his horse was picketed. Working swiftly, the
caballero put on saddle and bridle and led the animal
from beneath the ledge and down the watercourse.
A few minutes later he had mounted, and the horse
was trotting slowly along the crest of the hill.</p>

<p>The caballero did not under-estimate his danger. He
knew the <i>comandante</i> might have sent troopers to
scout in the surrounding country in an endeavour to
learn the intentions of the hostiles. Men and women
were driving in from the villages and every rancho
was sending its people to the protection of the mission,
for the alarm had gone out that afternoon, and he
did not wish to be seen by any of them. Moreover,
scouting Indians might be met, and these the caballero
feared most of all, not alone because of an attack they
might make, but because they might give chase, drive
him out of his course, delay him when delay was the
last thing he desired.</p>

<p>Yet he rode swiftly where he could, and trusted a
great deal to his horse, not following the principal
highway, but breaking a new trail over the hills, avoiding
the cañon where the old Indian camp had been,
striving to reach the Fernandez rancho from the opposite
side, where it was less likely sentinels had been
posted.</p>

<p>He had to guess at his location continually; had to
stop now and then to listen for sounds that would
have meant danger; had to use caution and make speed
at the same time, a difficult thing under such
conditions.</p>

<p>In time he saw the reflection from fires ahead of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
him, and knew he was not far from the cañon where
the Indians had been camped.</p>

<p>He approached warily, riding slowly around the base
of the butte as Sergeant Cassara had done. Dismounting,
he threw the reins over his horse’s head and went
forward alone, silently, foot by foot, fearing a stumble
over a stone might attract the attention of some Indian
sentinel and cause an alarm.</p>

<p>He reached the edge of the precipice and looked
down. Scores of fires were burning; scores of Indian
warriors were dancing; the groups of teepees told how
the savages had gathered, gentile and neophyte, for
this attempt to drive white men from the coast country
and reclaim the territory for their own.</p>

<p>For several minutes the caballero watched the scene
below, noting especially where a group of chiefs had
gathered before a large wigwam as if for a conference.
Then, fully determined, he slipped over the
edge of the precipice and started down to the floor of
the cañon, a perilous descent made more perilous by
the fact that escape would be difficult if his presence
were discovered.</p>

<p>He reached the bottom, and for a time rested behind
a clump of bushes, where the light from the fires
did not penetrate, breathing heavily because of his
exertion, listening to the chatter of a band of neophytes
near—neophytes who already quarrelled regarding the
division of certain goods in the mission storehouse.</p>

<p>Forward again, toward the wigwam, keeping out
of the light from the fires, going step by step and
cautiously, now backing into the brush when he came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
across a slumbering hostile, now daring a nearer approach
to the fires when the country made it necessary.</p>

<p>He reached a jumble of rocks directly behind the
wigwam, and stopped to rest again. He heard Indians
shrieking in the distance, heard the sound of
galloping hoofs, and saw riding down the line of fires
the man he had warned the <i>comandante</i> to watch.</p>

<p>“Then I was right, after all,” the caballero said, and
gripped his pistol for use in case of discovery.</p>

<p>The chiefs were standing now, awaiting the approach
of their white leader with evident courtesy,
and one of them stepped forward and grasped the
reins of the horse as he dismounted. An Indian took
the horse away; the chiefs and their white leader sat
down before the fire.</p>

<p>“You have satisfaction, Señor Rocha?” one of the
chiefs asked.</p>

<p>“Things appear to be as I had wished,” was the
reply. “We will attack to-morrow night, as we have
planned. The men have all arrived?”</p>

<p>“Except perhaps half a hundred who will be here
by morning,” said a chief. “A scout came in some
time ago, with the report that they are preparing for
defence at the mission.”</p>

<p>“Hah! Small good it will do them, except to cause
us more annoyance.”</p>

<p>“A soldier warned them, <i>señor</i>, it is said—a big
soldier who belongs not to the presidio here, but at
Santa Barbara.”</p>

<p>“I know him; I expected as much. Do some of you
remember this certain soldier when we attack, and take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
account of him. There has been nothing seen of the
man who tricked you?”</p>

<p>“None have seen him, <i>señor</i>. Either he has ridden
up El Camino Real to spread the alarm, or else is hiding
in the hills.”</p>

<p>“He is not to be slain, remember. I want that word
passed around. That man is mine when we take him
prisoner. Small wonder it is that he did not ruin our
plans!”</p>

<p>“How were we to know, <i>señor</i>? Those at the mission
treated him like a pestilence, and he led our men
to believe he was who he seemed. We did not guess
until he came here to the cañon and escaped when we
would have held him prisoner. Yet he is an outlaw
now—both white men and red seek him.”</p>

<p>“There is amusement to be found in that fact,” was
the laughing reply. “Remember that man is mine
when he is taken. And remember, also, what I said
about a guard to be left behind here at the rancho.
The women in the ranch-house are to be kept in their
room, and no one is to enter. No harm is to be offered
them. The younger one is to be my wife, you understand,
and the elder must remain with her to keep her
from being frightened.”</p>

<p>“It will be done, <i>señor</i>,” the chief replied, “though
every man wants to join in the attack on the mission.”</p>

<p>“Say to those left behind that I’ll see personally
they receive their share of any loot.”</p>

<p>“Very well, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“And now let us consider the plans for attack.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
It will be a task of some hours, but we want no
mistakes!”</p>

<p>The caballero waited to hear no more. Step by
step he withdrew from the wigwam and went back
into the brush. One thought rang in his brain—no
harm had come to Señorita Anita Fernandez and her
<i>duenna</i>; they merely were being held prisoners.</p>

<p>It was more difficult getting back to the crest than
it had been descending, and there was as much need
for caution. Through the darkness the caballero fought
his way upward, fearful of dislodging pebbles and
starting an avalanche that would betray him, grasping
carefully at projecting rocks and roots, straining
his muscles while the perspiration streamed from his
face and neck, urged on by the thought of the scant
time he had for his purpose.</p>

<p>In time he reached the top, and for a moment was
stretched exhausted on the ground, gasping for breath.
Then he arose and walked slowly toward where he
had left his horse, alert again, fearing discovery at
every step.</p>

<p>He mounted and rode slowly around the base of the
butte, and then across a pasture where there was no
reflection from the fires in the cañon. He could see
the lights in the ranch-house, heard Indians screeching
around it, and before one of the long adobe buildings
there was a great fire where the hostiles were
cooking.</p>

<p>The caballero estimated the task he had set himself
to do, and strove to keep from feeling downhearted;
for it seemed almost an impossible thing with a couple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
hundred hostiles scattered about the place. How was
he to reach the house, enter it, rescue two women and
escape again?</p>

<p>He stopped his horse in an angle of fence that
protected the yard of the ranch-house from grazing
herds, and fastened the animal there, then went forward
afoot, keeping in the shadow of the nearest adobe
building.</p>

<p>He was within half a hundred yards of the Indians
about the fire, but they seemed to be giving all their
attention to the preparation of food, trusting sentinels
posted on every road and trail to give warning of
approach.</p>

<p>He came to another horse tethered to the fence, a
splendid animal belonging to the rancho. It evidently
was being used by some chief or scout, for saddle
and bridle were on it, and remembering that he would
need a second horse, he untied the beast, led it back
to his own, and fastened it again.</p>

<p>Then he went forward once more, this time swinging
far out to one side and reaching a clump of palms
planted long ago by Señor Fernandez for a windbreak.
From there he could get a good view of the
house. The patio was filled with Indians; hostiles
were on the front veranda; they slept against the walls
and roamed through the vegetable garden on the other
side of the building.</p>

<p>A room in the front of the house was illuminated,
but none except Indians were in it, and they seemed
to be servants. To the rear was an additional half-storey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
and here was another room with a light in it;
and as the caballero watched the windows he saw a
shadow cast on the curtains.</p>

<p>The draperies were heavy and of brocaded stuff,
yet the outlines of the shadow could be discerned
plainly. Here was no squaw or hostile brave—here
was a white woman dressed in the mode of the times,
and the shadow, passing and repassing before the
window, told the caballero she paced the room in an
agony of fear.</p>

<p>Now he stretched himself on the ground and began
worming his way forward like an Indian, stopping
every few feet to listen, keeping to the shadows,
ready to curl up and pretend to be asleep if any came
near, hoping he would be taken for a sleeping hostile.
Fifty feet from the side of the house he stopped, disheartened
as he realised the futility of the plan. No
human being could reach the house and enter without
being seen, not with Indians scattered every few
feet along the walls and others continually running back
and forth from the veranda to the patio. He would
have to resort to a trick.</p>

<p>But tricks were not easily planned under such conditions.
No expedient could he contrive; every plan
was rejected as being worse than useless.</p>

<p>He heard a commotion behind him, and realised that
the hostiles were driving up the horses of the rancho
in preparation for to-morrow night’s raid. Two or
three hundred head were in the drove now milling near
the fence before the house. Cries of relief came from
the herders as they sprang over the fence and hurried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
toward the house for wine and food; and relief came
to the caballero as he crouched in the shadows, for
now he believed the way was clear.</p>

<p>He slipped back to the clump of palms, made another
circle, and so gained the fence, to climb it and
slip along it silently until he came to bars directly before
the ranch-house. Working swiftly to throw them
down, he then slipped back again and circled the drove
until he was behind the high-spirited, half-frightened
animals.</p>

<p>He grasped pistol in one hand; zarape in the other.
A moment of silence, then a shot, a screech, the snort
of a frightened steed, the sudden crowding of those
nearest him—then the drove was in frenzied fear—rearing,
kicking, plunging—striving to flee from this
unknown horror that had come behind them out of
the night.</p>

<p>The leaders broke through the bars; the others followed.
By scores they stampeded into the yard, carrying
all before them!</p>

<p>Shrieking hostiles fled from the raging beasts; a
chorus of cries came from the Indians scattered along
the walls. Around the end of the building and into
the patio itself the animals fled, crashing into the
arches, stumbling across the fountain, tearing down
vines and trees—flying menaces of hoofs and teeth that
scattered gentiles and neophytes as a volley from troopers
never would have done.</p>

<p>The caballero stopped beneath the palms to recharge
his pistol, and then he slipped quickly to the wall of
the house and the nearest window. The yard was clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
save where mangled bodies of hostiles told of the
horses’ frenzy. Another moment—and the caballero
was inside the house, standing in a dark room directly
under the window where the shadow crossed and recrossed
as a woman paced the floor.</p>

<span class="s8">THE WAY OUT</span></h2>

<p>Hysterics were over, weeping at an end.
Señora Vallejo now sat on the end of the
bed looking straight before her, and on her
face was an expression that told she was resigned to
whatever Fate had in store for her, that pride and
breeding and blood had come to her rescue and she
would be craven no more.</p>

<p>She held the poniard their last visitor had left behind.
None other had come; neither food nor water had been
offered them. And until Anita Fernandez, her spirit
broken, went to the window and called down to the
patio, none would come, they knew; and Señora
Vallejo knew, also, that Señorita Anita would die of
starvation before she would give in and ask mercy
at the hands of the man who had wronged her.</p>

<p>The <i>señora</i> watched as the girl paced back and forth,
her hands clenched at her sides, suffering from shame
and crushed pride.</p>

<p>“Will you not rest, Anita?” she asked, presently.</p>

<p>“How can there be rest for me,” the girl demanded,
“when a man of our blood is doing this thing?”</p>

<p>“He is but a distant relative—very distant.”</p>

<p>“Were he a million times removed, yet he is of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
branch of the Fernandez family. Whether this revolt
is successful or not, always will it be said, in speaking
of it, that a Fernandez was the instigator. It is not to
be endured!”</p>

<p>“Yet we must endure it!” the <i>señora</i> replied.</p>

<p>“Would death wipe out the stain, I had not lived
this long! Why did you take the poniard from me,
Señora Vallejo? Give it me again!”</p>

<p>“Death would not prevent the revolt, <i>señorita</i>, and
you are young to die.”</p>

<p>“And what remains but death? Would you have me
take this man as husband—this man with his treasonable
soul and bloody hands? Would you have me
reign queen over a nation of ignorant savages, with
a throne, sitting on a daïs of white men’s bones? How
he lured us here, so we might not be hurt at the mission,
so he could hold us until his nefarious work is
done! What dupes we have been! If he wins, what
hope is left? If he loses, how could I ever face the
good frailes and the soldiers and other decent men
again? Nothing but death is left—and even that will
not wash away the stain!”</p>

<p>A sudden noise in the fireplace in the corner—not
much of a noise, to be sure, but enough to be heard in
the silence that followed the girl’s outburst. She
stopped in the middle of the room, looking toward the
pile of wood there. Señora Vallejo turned with fear
in her face, and thus they remained, breathless, wondering
if they were about to face a new horror.</p>

<p>Again the noise—as if a dagger were being used
to pry the blocks of stone and adobe apart. Then a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
stone fell—and another—and then there was silence
for a moment, while the <i>señora</i> and the girl gazed
spellbound. The elder woman ran to the girl’s side
and clasped her in her arms; her hand gripped the
hilt of the poniard.</p>

<p>A third stone fell with a clatter. Again, silence.
Then a head appeared, slowly, inch by inch, first the
crown of black hair now covered with dust and soot,
then a sooty brow, two piercing eyes, a moustache
that looked absolutely disreputable now, a well-formed
mouth that flashed open in a smile and showed two
rows of even white teeth, an aggressive chin!</p>

<p>The two women scarcely breathed; their eyes seemed
to be bulging from their sockets. Two hands gripped
the edge of the fireplace, more blocks of adobe bulged,
and the man himself stumbled into the room, bowing
before them and throwing wide his arms as if to indicate
the state of his apparel.</p>

<p>“<i>Señorita! Señora!</i>” he said, and bowed again,
once to each of them.</p>

<p>“’Tis Captain Fly-by-Night!” the <i>señora</i> gasped.</p>

<p>“Such I am called, sweet lady. ’Tis unceremonious,
I realise, to call upon ladies without being announced,
especially when they are in a bed-chamber, and twice
especially when a man enters by means of a fireplace
that is none too clean. My condition desolates me,
<i>señora</i> and <i>señorita</i>, but circumstances are such that I
am unable to appear before you properly shaved and
dressed in clean clothing. I trust you will overlook
the matter this once? It never will happen again—if
I can prevent it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>“You? Here?” The <i>señorita</i> had found her voice
now.</p>

<p>“I do not wonder you have difficulty in recognising
me——”</p>

<p>“Troubles are not heavy enough upon us but we
must endure your presence?” she asked. “It is like
Captain Fly-by-Night to affront women when they are
unprotected, to offer violence——”</p>

<p>“Have I offered violence, sweet <i>señorita</i>?” he asked
pleasantly. “Have I said or done what I should not?”</p>

<p>“Why are you here? Why do you crawl through
the chimney like a thing of evil? For some good
purpose?”</p>

<p>“Possibly; you may be the best judge of that. My
purpose is to remove you from here—the two of you—and
take you where there are neither traitors nor
hostile Indians—to the mission, to be precise. I understand
the close of another day will see siege and
perhaps bloodshed at this same San Diego de Alcalá,
yet it would be better for you to withstand the one
and see the other than to remain at the Fernandez
rancho. For surely you realise your situation here. If
this revolt fails, as it will, you will be at the mercy
of furious gentiles. If it succeeds—well, if it succeeds,
you will at least be at the mercy of the traitor
who caused it to succeed——”</p>

<p>The girl interrupted him again.</p>

<p>“You speak boldly of traitors, Captain Fly-by-Night.
What about yourself?”</p>

<p>“You consider me one?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Is not the fact well known, <i>señor</i>? Did not word<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
come from the Governor that your perfidy was discovered,
and that you were to be taken dead or alive?
Have you not been fugitive these two days past?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes! His Excellency the Governor has, intentionally
or not, caused me some annoyance by that
same order. I must speak harshly to him when next
we meet. It is true also that I have been fugitive and
forced to use my poor wits to exist, with both soldiers
and redskins trying to run me down or run me
through.”</p>

<p>“So your Indians have turned upon you? You are a
double traitor, perhaps. It was only recently I learned
that this Rojerio Rocha, who—Heaven help me!—is
of a distant branch of my family, is a renegade dealing
with hostiles; and he as good as told me, here in this
very room, that you also were a renegade, that you
fought for leadership, since it was considered one white
general was enough. I believe he intimated, too, that
you fought concerning myself, regarding the question
as to whose property I was to be after your plans had
been carried out. ’Tis like Captain Fly-by-Night to
heap these additional insults upon an unprotected girl!”</p>

<p>“This man you call Rojerio Rocha said all that, eh?
Hah! How my blade will sing when we meet!”</p>

<p>“He expressed a wish to stand up to you again, I
believe. ’Twere a pity you did not slay each other!”</p>

<p>“When next we meet my blade shall do more than
pierce his shoulder, <i>señorita</i>, I promise you.”</p>

<p>“Almost could I forgive your baseness and your cruel
boasts concerning myself, if you did that! Almost
could I forgive your treason if you took the life of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
man who has put the stain of disloyalty upon our
name!”</p>

<p>“You speak freely of treason, <i>señorita</i>. I am no
traitor.”</p>

<p>“You—no traitor?” She threw back her head and
laughed loudly, scornfully.</p>

<p>“May I suggest that you lower your voice?” he
queried. “If you bring hostiles into the room all my
plans will have gone awry.”</p>

<p>“Your plans, <i>señor</i>?”</p>

<p>“To remove you and the <i>señora</i> to the mission,
<i>señorita</i>.”</p>

<p>She dropped the <i>señora’s</i> arms from about her and
took a step toward him, and again her hands were
clenched at her sides and her eyes blazed.</p>

<p>“Do you think I would stir a step from this place
with you?” she demanded. “Do you think I trust you?
Do you imagine you have skill enough, if I were
willing, to get two women out of this house, put them
in a carreta and drive them to the mission—when the
roads are watched, when there are plenty of horses and
ponies here for hostiles to use in chase?”</p>

<p>“’Tis a difficult proposition, I admit, yet I think it
can be solved successfully.”</p>

<p>“Leave this house with you?” she stormed at him.
“Go to the mission? How could I look a fray in the
face again? How could I even speak to my good
padre? How could I go to the presidio, where the
soldiers were wont to call me the regiment’s daughter?
‘Daughter of an accursed family that spread murder
and robbery throughout the coast country,’ they would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
say now. Here I am, Señor Fly-by-Night, in the home
of my father, with his good name besmirched by a
traitor, and here I remain, hoping death will come
quickly, even before I know whether this treasonable
plot succeeds.”</p>

<p>“The task will be more difficult than I had imagined,”
quoth the caballero.</p>

<p>“Go with you? Trust you?” she went on. “To
what purpose? You would steal me from this Rojerio
Rocha, eh? A pretty pair of rogues!”</p>

<p>Now he walked swiftly to her side and looked down
into her blazing eyes, and when he spoke it was in a
voice she never had heard before.</p>

<p>“<i>Señorita</i>,” he said, “I swear to you by all the saints,
by my dead mother’s honour, by whatever you will,
that I mean you no harm, and that my sole object is
to rescue you from this place and take you to the
mission, there to hand you over to your padre. I have
come here to-night at much risk, since both white and
red men seek me. I have used subterfuge and device
to reach you safely. And you must allow the rescue!”</p>

<p>Señora Vallejo would have spoken, but he silenced
her with a wave of his hand and looked at the girl
again.</p>

<p>“And I say to you I am no traitor, <i>señorita</i>,” he went
on. “Never have I raised my hand against His Excellency
the Governor, never have I conspired with
Indians. In time, things may be explained; for the
present I ask you to believe me.”</p>

<p>“Yet you are Captain Fly-by-Night—gambler,
swindler, wronger of women!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span></p>

<p>“Which has nothing to do with this present rescue.”</p>

<p>“Save this,” she added, quickly, “that Señorita Anita
Fernandez does not trust herself with Captain Fly-by-Night,
no matter what the circumstances.”</p>

<p>The caballero sighed and turned on one heel to walk
back to the fireplace, there to stand for a moment in
thought.</p>

<p>“It is, in a word, a difficult proposition,” he confessed.
“Here I am in this house after having difficulties,
trying to be a hero and rescue a damsel in
distress, also her <i>duenna</i>, and the damsel refuses to be
rescued.”</p>

<p>“Then depart as you came!” the <i>señorita</i> said.</p>

<p>“The damsel,” he went on, scratching his head and
not even looking at her, “does not fully appreciate the
condition of things. She does not realise in other
words, what is for her own good in this matter. The
<i>duenna</i>, not having spoken, naturally leaves things to
the caballero——”</p>

<p>“I remain here, Captain Fly-by-Night,” Señora
Vallejo interrupted. “And do you show what small
spark of manhood you may have left by quitting these
women’s quarters, where you are an uninvited guest.”</p>

<p>“Excellent! Always insist on the proprieties, even
with half a thousand red wretches within call ready to
commit every crime known to man!” the caballero
replied. He looked up suddenly, and the women were
frightened at the expression that now came into his
face. “You, <i>señora</i>, and you, <i>señorita</i>,” he went on,
“say you know my reputation as Captain Fly-by-Night.
Suppose I say to you, then, that I am a desperate man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
that we are done with pleasantries, and that you must
do as I say or expect violence? You understand me,
do you not? I am done with playing. Now you must
obey!”</p>

<p>His voice was stern as he bent toward them and
volleyed the words. His eyes seemed to flash in rage,
and with two strides he had reached the head of the
bed, and tore from it a scarf Señorita Anita had worn,
and turned to approach the girl.</p>

<p>His movements were so swift that there was no time
for the woman to act. He grasped the girl around the
waist, and with the scarf he stifled her scream of fright
in her throat.</p>

<p>“Not a word from you, either, <i>señora</i>!” he commanded;
and began winding the scarf around the girl’s
head, so that she could make no sound. He picked
her up, then, and carried her to the bed and put her
upon it, and in a moment had torn the bed covering
to strips and tied the girl’s hands behind her back and
fastened her feet together. Two frightened eyes
looked up at him, a low moan came from her, but that
was all.</p>

<p>Señora Vallejo was crouched by the fireplace, half
stunned with fear, clutching at the poniard. He
whirled upon her and she opened her mouth to scream;
but he reached her side in time to clap a hand over her
lips and choke the scream back into her throat. Once
she struck at him with the poniard; and he laughed
lightly as he grasped her wrist, took the weapon from
her, and placed it in his belt beside his own.</p>

<p>“Listen, <i>señora</i>!” he said. “You will do as I say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
in everything, without making the least sound, for, by
all the saints, if you as much as utter a gurgle I’ll slit
your throat like I would a rabbit’s. You understand
me, <i>señora</i>? I am master now. Let fear paralyse your
vocal cords if you would save your life!”</p>

<p>He hurried back to the bed and picked up the girl,
then strode to the fireplace again.</p>

<p>“In you go, <i>señora</i>!” he ordered. “’Tis but a drop
of six feet, and though there is dust and soot it will not
harm you. Drop straight into the darkness, and when
you are at the bottom stand still. And not a gasp, else
your blood will mingle with the soot!”</p>

<p>“I—I can’t!” the <i>señora</i> gasped.</p>

<p>“Then will I be saved trouble by slitting your throat
and leaving you here! Down, <i>señora</i>!”</p>

<p>Trying hard to stifle her sobs of fear, the bulky
<i>señora</i> placed her feet in the hole and slowly lowered
herself until her head was on a level with the floor.
There stopped, with eyes bulging, until the caballero
made a motion with the poniard. And then she let go
and dropped, to fall with a thump at the bottom of the
chimney in a shower of soot.</p>

<p>The caballero listened a moment, until he was sure
nobody on the floor had been attracted by the sound,
and then he lowered the girl down the chimney, and
followed to stand beside the <i>señora</i> in the darkness.</p>

<p>“The window!” he whispered. “Allow me to say,
<i>señora</i>, that we are going through the window to the
yard, then across the yard to the fence, where I have
horses waiting. I advise you to move silently and
listen for my orders, and obey them, for the least slip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
will mean discovery, and that will mean a quick journey
for you to a land where there are neither hostiles nor
neophytes—let us hope! The window, <i>señora</i>!”</p>

<p>“I—I cannot!”</p>

<p>“Then you will be found here on the floor with a slit
throat! I am not a man to be trifled with, I assure
you! And as for saying that you cannot, a person can
do many impossible things when death is behind them
and gaining steadily. The window, <i>señora</i>!”</p>

<p>The caballero looked out first to see that the coast
was clear. There were no Indians on that side of the
house now. The majority of them were in pursuit
of the fleeing horses, following the stampede, and
others were in the patio discussing what had caused the
animals to become suddenly insane with fear when it
was apparent to all sensible persons that there was
nothing of which to be afraid.</p>

<p>He stepped back and motioned to the <i>señora</i>, and
she began the task of getting through the window and
to the ground below, finally falling with a grunt to the
sward. In an instant the caballero stood beside her,
with the <i>señorita</i> in his arms.</p>

<p>The <i>señora</i> was guided by whispers now, but they
were accompanied by such direful hisses that she continued
to tremble with fear. Each instant she expected
to feel steel pierce her back, thinking the caballero but
awaited an excuse to put her out of the way, and so
carry off the <i>señorita</i>.</p>

<p>They reached the clump of palms and rested there
for a moment while the caballero listened to the sounds
that came from the black night about them. Then they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
went forward again, slowly, careful to make no noise.</p>

<p>Now they had reached the fence, and because of the
caballero’s whispered threats the <i>señora</i> managed to
climb it. They came to where the horses were tethered,
and there the caballero commanded silence while he
listened again, fearing someone might have found the
horses and was waiting to see who would claim them.</p>

<p>“That steed will be yours, <i>señora</i>,” he said, pointing
it out.</p>

<p>“I cannot ride,” she moaned.</p>

<p>“Then here is where you acquire that accomplishment,
<i>señora</i>, else here is where you die. It desolates
me that there is not a lady’s saddle on the mount, but
it was impossible to provide one. However, the night
is dark——”</p>

<p>“Ride a man’s saddle? Never!” the <i>señora</i> gasped.</p>

<p>“Then I am quit of one trouble, and the horse will
not be needed, since I mean to carry the <i>señorita</i> on
mine.”</p>

<p>“Ah, <i>señor</i>, for the love of the saints——”</p>

<p>“Mount, <i>señora</i>! Up, as I aid you! We cannot
remain here until dawn!”</p>

<p>In imagination she saw him reach toward his belt,
and fear gave her strength. Señora Vallejo got into
the man’s saddle, and bent forward to grasp the horse’s
mane, feeling as much fear for the animal as for the
man.</p>

<p>“Do not strangle him, <i>señora</i>,” the caballero suggested
lightly, and sprang into his own saddle, with
Señorita Anita before him.</p>

<p>The girl had ceased moaning some time before, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
the caballero did not remove the scarf. Though he
could not see because of the darkness, he sensed that
her eyes were flashing angrily and that yet she did not
trust him fully, did not believe he was making this
rescue in good faith.</p>

<p>He urged his horse forward, and bent over to catch
the rein of Señora Vallejo’s animal, and so moved away
from the fence, guiding his own mount with his knees,
holding the girl and leading the steed that the <i>señora</i>
clutched violently by the mane, expecting every moment
to be hurled to the ground.</p>

<p>They made a great circle, getting a butte between
themselves and the rancho, and then the caballero urged
the animals into a trot. No fear of death could stay
Señora Vallejo’s tongue then. Two shrieks came from
her throat in quick succession so like Indian wails that
the caballero thanked his saints nobody would be
attracted by them. But he felt called upon to stop the
horses and make a statement.</p>

<p>“Another chirp like that, <i>señora</i>, and your body is
found here in the pasture at daybreak,” he warned.
“Clutch the horn of the saddle and leave the animal his
hair. Bounce, if you will, but do not scream.”</p>

<p>And he started the horses again, and the <i>señora</i>
bounced, and though she screamed no more, yet she
breathed ladylike imprecations upon the caballero and
all horses, no matter of what breed. Faster and faster
he urged the steeds, until the <i>señora</i> was in a panic of
fear, had given up all hope and expected death momentarily
beneath the horse’s hoofs—but clung on,
nevertheless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span></p>

<p>Now the caballero stopped and listened, and then
began unwrapping the scarf from the <i>señorita’s</i> head.
She gave a gasp as it fell away, a sob, another moan.</p>

<p>“<i>Señorita!</i>” the caballero said, and his voice was soft
again.</p>

<p>“<i>Señorita</i>, will you not speak to me and say that you
forgive? There was no other way, believe me, for
you were so determined. You did not trust me, and
time was short and the danger great. It was to
save you.”</p>

<p>“From one shame for another?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Not for all the world would I wrong you, offer you
harm, hurt your feelings!” he said. “You do not
understand, <i>señorita</i>. Back there at the rancho there
was naught but danger for you, no matter what the
outcome of this revolt. It is better you are at the
mission with decent people, and there I am taking you
now. It were better to die there, <i>señorita</i>, with your
<i>duenna</i>, and go to death unsullied, than to live and be at
the rancho when this revolt is over.”</p>

<p>“Unsullied!” she cried. “How can that ever be now,
since Rojerio Rocha has done this thing?”</p>

<p>“I would not dwell on that, <i>señorita</i>, at the present
time. The night is passing, and we must hurry on
to the mission, and we can make none too good time
considering the <i>señora’s</i> horsewomanship.” She was
sure there was the sound of mirth in his voice. “I
ask you only to trust me for the time being, and to
do one other thing—when the fighting begins at the
mission, repair to the guest house with your <i>duenna</i> and
remain there, despite any orders to the contrary. Do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
this, and I swear you’ll never meet death at the hands
of hostiles.”</p>

<p>“How can you promise that, when you dare not
approach the mission or presidio yourself?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Trust me, and ask no questions.”</p>

<p>“I cannot forget you are Captain Fly-by-Night. It
is almost an insult to be rescued by such a man.”</p>

<p>She felt his hands grip her for an instant, then the
pressure of them relax, and to her ears came a whisper
so low that even Señora Vallejo could not hear.</p>

<p>“<i>Señorita!</i> Since first I saw you I have longed to
hold you in my arms as I am doing now. Since you
taunted me down by the creek I have loved you. You
are mine, though you think it not. And do not now
speak of insults, else will I crush your red lips with
mine! What I have been, or who, or what or who I
am now—still I love you as a strong man loves, with
my whole heart—and for you I would gladly die if it
would save you pain.”</p>

<p>He started the horses again, since she did not answer.
Neither did she struggle to get from his arms, as he
had expected she would do. For half a mile they rode
in silence, carefully, making their way over the hills
toward the mission, avoiding all roads and trails. And
then, suddenly, two arms slipped around his neck to
pull down his head, and a voice breathed into his ear:</p>

<p>“Prove your words, Captain Fly-by-Night. I am
motherless, fatherless, and the man who was to have
been my husband has cast shame upon my family.
There seems just now no future for me among reputable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
persons. Who am I to taunt you with your past
and reputation—I, daughter of a family of traitors?”</p>

<p>“Do not speak so, <i>señorita</i>!” he said.</p>

<p>“I do speak so! Perhaps you are more the man
than I have thought. May I put you to the test?”</p>

<p>“Gladly will I stand it!” he said.</p>

<p>“Then prove at least that you will help remove this
stain on our family name. Prove that you are not
partners with the man who put it there. Prove that,
though outcast at present, and pursued by white men
and red, you are a loyal man. Do one thing for me,
Captain Fly-by-Night, and I will try to think better of
you, and I will go on to the mission freely and remain
in the guest house looking to you for help, as you
have suggested. I can promise nothing more, but, if
this much will content you for the time being——”</p>

<p>“Name what it is you would have me do, <i>señorita</i>!”
he said.</p>

<p>“A thing that perhaps you will not dislike. Kill me
this Rojerio Rocha!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII"><span class="tall-2">CHAPTER XVII<br></span>

<span class="s8">“PERSPIRATION, SEÑORITA!”</span></h2>

<p>As she spoke he had imagined a score of things
she would ask him to do, but never this. He
realised by her words and the tone of her low
voice how the girl had been struck to the heart
by the thought of a member of her family—no matter
of how distant a branch—turning traitor and renegade.</p>

<p>There had been a quality of vehemence in her sentence
that had struck him like a blow. Unconsciously
he started, and unconsciously his heels swung back and
his spurs dug into the flanks of his horse. The movement
was mechanical; he had seemed to try to dodge
her sentence as he would have touched his steed to
dodge the blow of a mounted swordsman.</p>

<p>With a snort of fright at this unexpected and unmerited
severity, the horse sprang to one side, almost
unseating its rider and hurling him and the girl to the
ground. The animal Señora Vallejo rode reared suddenly,
and the <i>señora</i> gave a shrill screech and tried to
clasp her steed’s neck. But the unexpected application
of spurs to his mount saved the caballero’s life, perhaps,
for even as the horse sprang a musket spoke and a
bullet whistled past uncomfortably close, and an Indian
sentinel’s shrieking challenge came out of the night,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
to be caught up by another far to one side, and by still
another, until it seemed that they had ridden into a
hostile camp.</p>

<p>The caballero clasped the <i>señorita</i> closer and galloped
madly after the horse the <i>señora</i> rode, for the woman
was shrieking in her fright and the caballero was
afraid she would be thrown and injured. Another
musket spoke from a thicket as they flew past, and for
an instant the caballero loosened his grip of the reins
and swayed forward in the saddle, but almost immediately
he sat straight again and peered ahead, trying
to locate the other horse.</p>

<p>The footing was secure here where the ground was
comparatively level, and soon he rode beside the other
steed and reached out to grasp the reins. Gradually he
forced both animals to a canter, finally to a walk.</p>

<p>“It desolates me to think you have sustained fright,
<i>señorita</i>, and you, <i>señora</i>,” he said. “Luckily the
horses sensed our enemies and galloped of their own
account, else one or more of us might be slain, wounded
or prisoner now. That was the last outpost of the
hostiles, I imagine; nevertheless it will repay us to
move with caution the rest of the distance. ’Tis but
another mile to the mission, and soon we will be in the
midst of their sentinels, if they have any out. One
force is as dangerous for me as the other.”</p>

<p>“I doubt whether I can ride the other mile,” said
the <i>señora</i>, gaspingly. “Do you ride on and save the
<i>señorita</i>; if the hostiles catch me I shall die as becomes
a woman of my blood.”</p>

<p>“You’ll die immediately with a slit throat if you do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
not ride on!” the caballero announced, angrily; and the
<i>señora</i> moaned and rode on; only the <i>señorita</i> detected
the note of amusement in the caballero’s voice.</p>

<p>They had come out upon the highway now, knowing
that no hostile would be there so close to the mission,
and the caballero slowed the horses to a walk again,
letting the eager <i>señora</i> ride a few feet ahead.</p>

<p>“Some minutes ago you asked me a question,
<i>señorita</i>,” he said. “Rather, say that you issued a
command. So you would have me slay this Rojerio
Rocha?”</p>

<p>“He should pay the penalty for the infamy he has
cast on our name, <i>señor</i>. And you would like to slay
him anyway; you have said so yourself.”</p>

<p>“I am making a point of that, <i>señorita</i>—am I slaying
him for you or for myself?”</p>

<p>“I care not, as long as he is slain. I would you could
do it before the attack begins! Yet you do not seem
eager to aid in saving the good names of Fernandez
and Rocha, it appears. Is it true, then, that you both
are leaders of the Indians, but jealous of each other’s
leadership?”</p>

<p>“I have told you I am no traitor, <i>señorita</i>.”</p>

<p>“Casting a stain upon my name is not enough cause
to have you kill a man, then?”</p>

<p>“The man has done enough to merit death, no
doubt.”</p>

<p>“If that is not enough, there is more—a personal
insult.”</p>

<p>“Personal insult, <i>señorita</i>?” he asked.</p>

<p>“He—he told me that after the attack had succeeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
he would make me his wife. When I told him I would
sooner die than wed such an infamous traitor he said—said
that I would come to him, marriage or no
marriage——”</p>

<p>“By the saints! He said that?” the caballero cried.
“Is there no drop of gentle blood in his veins?”</p>

<p>“My blood, <i>señor</i>,” she reminded him.</p>

<p>“No more your blood than the water of that creek,
<i>señorita</i>. Do not protest! I know not what strain
flows in his arteries, but it is none like flows in yours.
The man dies, <i>señorita</i>. I regret but one thing—that
I cannot slay him twice, once for you and once for
myself. He has a heavy score to be settled, this man!</p>

<p>“But here we must stop. It is but two hundred yards
to the mission, and I dare not approach nearer. Moreover,
I have things to do before dawn. May God and
the saints guard you, <i>señorita</i>, and you, <i>señora</i>, during
the trials that are to come. I regret that you’ll have
to dismount, else ride with the <i>señora</i>——”</p>

<p>“Gladly will I walk the remainder of the way,”
Señora Vallejo said, “if you will aid me to the ground.
I doubt, however, whether I can use my legs for several
minutes.”</p>

<p>“Walk slowly up the roadway,” the caballero instructed.
“You will meet guards, no doubt. If they
challenge, you must answer immediately and inform
them of your identity. I will try to attract their attention
when you have gone a little way, and let them
know you are approaching.”</p>

<p>He helped the <i>señora</i> to the ground, then returned to
his horse and reached up for the <i>señorita</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span></p>

<p>“You have not untied my feet and arms,” she reminded
him.</p>

<p>“<i>Dios!</i> That I should have forgotten that! Can
you ever forgive me, sweet lady? So many things have
happened lately that I am beginning to have a poor
memory.... There! Take a step or two to restore
circulation. Hold to my arm——”</p>

<p>“Your arm is wet!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Perspiration, <i>señorita</i>. There—I think you can
walk now. Remember what I have said—remain in
the guest house when the attack begins, no matter what
others may wish you to do. As for this man who
insulted you—he shall pay the price. <i>Adios, señorita!</i>”</p>

<p>He carried her hand to his lips and kissed it, though
she made futile effort at withdrawal.</p>

<p>“<i>Adios</i>, Captain Fly-by-Night,” she said; and disappeared
in the darkness.</p>

<p>The caballero waited until the sound of the women’s
footsteps had died away, then he mounted his horse
again, took out his pistol, and fired into the air. A
quick challenge came from the distance.</p>

<p>“Attention, <i>señores</i>!” he called. “Do not fire at the
roadway—Señora Vallejo and Señorita Fernandez
come!”</p>

<p>An exclamation of incredulity answered him; he
heard Anita calling in her own voice; then he slapped
the horse Señora Vallejo had ridden and sent it back
up the road, and swung his own mount toward the hill.</p>

<p>“‘<i>Señor</i>, your arm is wet,’” he mimicked. “By the
saints, that was rare indeed! ‘Perspiration, <i>señorita</i>,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
said I. Hah! Excellent—if it was not so inconvenient—and
painful!”</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the guest house a few minutes later Señorita Anita
Fernandez happened to glance down at her hand. She
gasped in surprise and understanding when she saw
blood on it.</p>

<span class="s8">FOES IN WAITING</span></h2>

<p>A grey dawn came that morning to San Diego
de Alcalá, for the heavy fog hung like a pall
over the valley, rolling in great billows against
the hills. The mission bells rang, and into the
church trooped frailes, soldiers, ranch owners, loyal
neophytes, none appearing more devout than those same
soldiers whose license and cruelty had done much to
make the Indians dissatisfied and undo the work of the
frailes. Collectively they may have been a boisterous,
fighting, drinking, gambling lot—but individually they
were properly religious.</p>

<p>The <i>comandante</i> had taken charge and done everything
possible in preparing the defence. It had come to
a question of deciding between presidio and mission,
for there were not men enough to defend both. It was
a question, too, which the hostiles would attack first—the
presidio offered arms and ammunition, food and
wine; the mission offered more loot. Did the savages
have greater hatred for the soldiers or the “long
gowns”?—that was the question the <i>comandante</i> would
have liked to have had answered.</p>

<p>Sergeant Cassara, pacing the plaza after service,
pulled at his long moustache and waited for his officer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
to appear. There were some things Cassara had not
fathomed. With his own eyes he had seen the savages
take Rojerio Rocha to the house at the rancho, and he
knew that the women had been there. And now, so he
had been told, both women were back at the mission,
and unharmed. This was something new in Indian
warfare.</p>

<p>The <i>comandante</i> came from the church, two of the
older frailes with him, and went toward the padres’
quarters, Cassara falling in behind. Since there was
no other officer here, Cassara, by virtue of his long
experience, had been appointed a temporary second in
command.</p>

<p>Inside the building, with the door closed and a man
on guard outside to prevent interruption, the frailes sat
down at a long table, the <i>comandante</i> at the head of it,
Sergeant Cassara at the foot. There was silence for a
moment, and then the lieutenant lifted his head and
looked down the length of the table, ignoring the frailes
and gazing straight into Cassara’s eyes when he spoke.</p>

<p>“Ensign Sanchez of Santa Barbara is due this
morning with twenty men, unless he has met with
disaster on the highway. I understand from the courier
who arrived late last night that Sanchez has picked up
some good fighters along the way, especially at Reina
de Los Angeles, where the old pirate, Gonzales, now a
godly man, and some of his cronies joined the
standard.”</p>

<p>“Give me a score of men like this Gonzales and we
sweep the hostiles into the sea!” Cassara exclaimed.</p>

<p>The lieutenant rebuked him with a glance, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
sergeant, his face flushing, turned to look through the
window.</p>

<p>“Not a man among us but is worth a dozen Indians,”
the <i>comandante</i> went on. “Yet we are not more than
a hundred if Sanchez arrives in time. We can expect
no help from San Luis Rey de Francia—on the other
hand, Sanchez may see fit to leave a part of his force
there. Two hundred good men are coming south with
the Governor, who has taken care of things in the north
and now hopes to stamp out the rebellion here. But
they cannot arrive for perhaps two days more. <i>Señores</i>,
we must hold out until then! And my scouts report
that the savages number at least a thousand now, and
are well supplied with arms and ammunition.”</p>

<p>No man made answer; there seemed no answer to
make. The <i>comandante</i> had stated the gist of the
matter, and it was for him to make any decisions he
wished.</p>

<p>“Is it to be the presidio or the mission?” a fray
asked, after a time of silence.</p>

<p>“The mission,” the <i>comandante</i> said. “I have decided
that. I am having arms and ammunition moved
here from the presidio.”</p>

<p>“I thank you, <i>señor</i>,” the fray returned. “We would
rather die on the steps of the church, if we are to die in
this manner.”</p>

<p>“Now who prates of dying?” Cassara burst out. “Is
this a council of war or a funeral? If we are going into
this fight already whipped, then I mount my horse and
trot up to San Luis Rey de Francia in search of men
of spirit!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span></p>

<p>“Peace, sergeant!” the <i>comandante</i> cried. “There
will be fighting enough! I believe all our plans are
made, <i>señores</i>. It desolates me to think we have not
sufficient force to make a sally and carry the fighting
to the enemy, but we dare not risk it. The renegade
who commands the hostiles probably has prepared for
that.”</p>

<p>“And what renegade commands?” Cassara desired to
know. “Name him, for the love of the saints, so I’ll
know him when we meet face to face!”</p>

<p>“The matter appears to be undecided,” returned one
of the frailes. “We had thought this Captain Fly-by-Night
was the renegade, and think so yet, knowing his
character, but it seems the Indians have turned against
him——”</p>

<p>“Or have pretended to turn against him and are
playing a deep trick,” Cassara interrupted. “What has
become of the scoundrel?”</p>

<p>“’Twas he fetched the women back to the mission
unharmed,” the <i>comandante</i> replied.</p>

<p>“<i>Dios!</i> ’Twas he? Will someone explain this
business?”</p>

<p>“Señora Vallejo appears to be on the verge of
hysterics and will say little,” a fray responded, “except
that this Fly-by-Night invaded a room occupied by the
women at the rancho, and forced them to accompany
him. He conducted them here in safety. His object
in so doing is not known fully.”</p>

<p>“Hah! And this Rojerio Rocha—what became of
him?”</p>

<p>“I can learn nothing from the women regarding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
Señor Rocha, except that Señorita Anita gasped out he
is still at the rancho, and that it is too horrible to mention.
The hostiles are holding him for torture, perhaps.
There is deadly enmity between Señor Rocha and
Captain Fly-by-Night.”</p>

<p>“Hah! Is there, by any chance, a possibility that
this Señor Rocha himself is a renegade and leads the
hostiles?” Sergeant Cassara demanded.</p>

<p>“<i>Señor!</i>” the fray cried. “Rojerio Rocha is of a
distant branch of the Fernandez family, heir to the old
<i>señor</i>, and is to wed the Señorita Anita. Moreover, I
happen to know that he is a personal friend to the
Governor.”</p>

<p>“The trunk of a tree cannot always control its
branches,” the sergeant observed, “and most certainly
cannot prevent any foul bird from building nest in
them. That is a deep saying—eh, fray? Ponder over
it while you are waiting for the fighting to begin.”</p>

<p>“I think your suspicion is an injustice,” the fray returned.
“It is more likely this Fly-by-Night has held
Rojerio Rocha for torture, since he knows Señor Rocha
is expected to wed our Anita, and he himself has made
boasts that he would win her.”</p>

<p>“At any rate, this Captain Fly-by-Night is a clever
rogue,” the sergeant declared. “Hah! I have a score
or two to settle with that fine caballero when next we
meet!”</p>

<p>“And I!” the <i>comandante</i> added.</p>

<p>“May the saints give him to my blade!... Is there
more to be done before the imps of Hades descend
upon us?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>A fray reported.</p>

<p>“I have had all water casks filled, as was ordered, for
human use and to fight fire. There is not a break on
the four sides of the plaza except at the end of the
adobe wall; and there we left room for Ensign Sanchez
and his men to enter.”</p>

<p>Cheers came to them now from the plaza, and the
sergeant rushed to a window, then whirled toward the
others with a glad cry.</p>

<p>“Sanchez has come!” he shouted. “And that dear
pirate of a Gonzales is with him. Now bring on your
gentiles and disloyal neophytes and your renegades and
your Captain Fly-by-Night! Hah! My ensign has
come!”</p>

<p>He ran to the door, hurled it open, and sprang out
into the plaza, his sword clattering at his heels.</p>

<p>“Hah! I am myself again!” he roared. “Ensign
I salute you! Comrades, it is a treat to see you again!
How like you El Camino Real in haste, eh? Gonzales,
good pirate, come to my arms!”</p>

<p>They laughed as they surged forward and around
him, slapping him on his broad shoulders, grasping at
his hands, crying jests and strange oaths at their happiness
in seeing him again.</p>

<p>“Look around you, comrades!” the sergeant invited.
“What you see you like, take it! While our ensign
greets the <i>comandante</i> here—a fine fellow, by the way,
but not quite up to our Santa Barbara standard—I’ll
show you what has been done in the way of defence.
There is a corner from where a man can command the
slope——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span></p>

<p>Gonzales interrupted him with a slap on the back
so hearty that it took away the sergeant’s breath.</p>

<p>“A truce to your blabbing!” cried the former pirate.
“Thrice have I opened jaws to ask a question, and
always you spoke again before I could have a word.
Where is this precious Captain Fly-by-Night? If
already you have slain him, then—by the saints!—I’ll
have at you myself! Hah! Where is the rogue?”</p>

<p>“Ah, wouldst see Captain Fly-by-Night?” the sergeant
asked. “A rogue, is he? Now when did he
cross your path, good pirate? Is he your friend or
foe?”</p>

<p>“Is he? There’ll be one sergeant less for the hostiles
to combat if you dare intimate the man to be friend of
mine! A pretty scoundrel! Where crossed he my
path? Hah! Like a whirlwind he descended upon the
pueblo of Reina de Los Angeles one night, as you know
very well, Cassara mine! ‘Fray Felipe of San Fernando
says I am an honest man, and that you are one,’
he states. ‘I would sleep until an hour before dawn,’
he states. ‘You will care for my animal and give me a
couch and food?’ he states.”</p>

<p>“I dare say he got what he requested,” Cassara put
in, trying to choke back a laugh.</p>

<p>“Did he? The rogue! Did I not sit up all night,
musket in hand, pistol at belt, sword ready, to guard
the wretch? Did I not have my Indian prowling around
the house alert for sneaks? Did I not rub down the
scoundrel’s horse? And in the morning did I not ride
with him a short distance on his way and give him my
blessing? Hah! ‘These are turbulent times,’ I suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
to him. ‘So I have understood,’ he states. ‘Perhaps
you think me a man I am not,’ he states. To my
face, the rogue! And, in my wisdom, I wink one eye
and slap him on the back and send him on his way.
<i>Dios!</i>”</p>

<p>“We all make mistakes,” Cassara observed.</p>

<p>“He warned me of another traveller, and I play with
this same other man and lose good gold, seeking to delay
him. I do delay him—to find I have hindered the Governor’s
good messenger and given aid to the renegade.
And you ask me why I want to see him? Hah! Where
is he to be found?”</p>

<p>“Answer me that, good pirate, and I bless you! My
blade waits for him!”</p>

<p>“After I am through,” Gonzales suggested.</p>

<p>“I have first claim,” Cassara declared.</p>

<p>“The man is mine, I say. If he dares show his face,
all must stand aside and let me at him!”</p>

<p>“Hah! Stand aside for you, pirate?” Cassara cried.
“Captain Fly-by-Night comes to me, and I would have
all men know it!”</p>

<p>“Now, by all the good saints, this passes a jest! I
say the man comes to my blade. Have I not the better
right?”</p>

<p>“There are three of us,” Cassara said. “The
<i>comandante</i> here at San Diego de Alcalá has a score to
settle with the rogue. Yet I think I shall spit him——”</p>

<p>“By what right? Wherein has he put shame upon
you?” demanded Gonzales.</p>

<p>“Hah! As to that——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>“Speak, Sergeant Cassara, and let these men judge.
Why have you the better right?”</p>

<p>Cassara’s face grew purple suddenly, for there came
to him a vision of the barracks-room at the presidio,
himself and two soldiers bound hand and foot and
fastened to stools, a grinning gentile watching them—while
Captain Fly-by-Night slept in an adjoining
room.</p>

<p>“Let the men judge!” Gonzales was shouting.</p>

<p>Cassara choked in embarrassment. Tell the outrage
this Caballero had put upon him—tell it to the grinning
troopers? A courageous man was the Santa Barbara
sergeant, but not courageous enough for that.</p>

<p>“I fight you for him!” he roared, and started to draw
blade. Nor was Gonzales a bit backward. In an
instant their swords had crossed, in another they would
have been at it. But Ensign Sanchez, who had come
from the guest house with the <i>comandante</i>, interposed
his own blade and separated them.</p>

<p>“A truce to such quarreling!” he ordered. “This
Fly-by-Night is my quarry, <i>señores</i>! He is to be left
to me, I would have all men know. Did he not make
a dunce of me at Santa Barbara? ‘Can you conceive a
reason why a gentleman might not want his name
shouted for all men to hear?’ he asked. ‘You know
the state of the times, I take it.’ Hah! Did I not wine
and dine him? He comes to my blade!”</p>

<p>“Now, by the saints! If this rogue appears at any
of the four points of the compass, he meets a <i>señor</i>
awaiting him!” Cassara said. “’Tis to be a matter of
luck, then.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>A fray entered the conversation.</p>

<p>“Were Rojerio Rocha with us, no doubt he would
want to claim this Fly-by-Night,” he said.</p>

<p>“Rojerio Rocha had his chance at him,” Cassara
replied.</p>

<p>“And did not you?” Ensign Sanchez demanded.
“Did he not stand up to you at Santa Barbara?”</p>

<p>“Devil and Hades!” the sergeant cried. “I shall go
mad! Hah! May the imps of evil, even, pity the
scoundrel when I meet him! The more I think of it—Juan
and Claudio, eh? Hah! Play cards for a mule?
‘Not that pack of cards, <i>señor</i>,’ the wretch says. ‘This
is to be a game of chance, not of skill,’ he says. Fury!
‘Do you keep up your fencing practice,’ he says. <i>I
shall go mad!</i>”</p>

<p>Cassara swept his naked blade in a great circle at
arm’s length, and the others sprang out of his way
roaring with laughter. Across the plaza stamped the
irate man, stopping before the store house to lift a water
jug and drink deeply.</p>

<p>And then a neophyte stopped before the <i>comandante</i>
and ensign and bowed respectfully.</p>

<p>“<i>Señores</i>,” he begged, “allow me to say it is an easy
matter to settle this quarrel. I am Pedro, servant at
the guest house, and I swear by the saints I am a loyal
neophyte and ready to die for the frailes and the
<i>señores</i>. Moreover, I have been servant to the Señorita
Anita since she has abided at the mission——”</p>

<p>“But the quarrel, man! How settle it?” laughed the
<i>comandante</i>.</p>

<p>“This Captain Fly-by-Night boasted concerning the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
<i>señorita</i>, thus insulting her; did he not? Do you four
<i>señores</i> fight bravely against the others—and let me
kill this Fly-by-Night!”</p>

<p>A roar of laughter answered him. He bowed again,
but did not turn away, and they saw he was sincere in
his request.</p>

<p>“This Fly-by-Night appears to be loved with an
enduring affection,” Ensign Sanchez said, sarcastically.
“I suppose we must leave the matter to chance, and
each of us pray the rogue falls to his blade.”</p>

<span class="s8">CASSARA SEES A GHOST</span></h2>

<p>Men spent the afternoon in boisterous revelry,
for all preparations to withstand a siege had
been made and they awaited the attack, but
they grew silent toward evening, pondering over what
might occur.</p>

<p>Their nervousness was apparent. Scarcely one inside
the plaza but had participated in outbreaks before, and
scarcely one that had not sustained wounds. But other
revolts had come unexpectedly, as rain from a clear
sky, whereas this was anticipated, of much moment,
and naught could be done to prevent it.</p>

<p>Dusk came, and a heavy fog rolled up the valley from
the distant bay to grow heavier as the hours passed, and
shut out moon and stars. Not a light was to be seen
in any of the buildings at the mission; not a torch
burned on the plaza.</p>

<p>Soldiers were at their stations, whispering to one
another, striding back and forth nervously, fumbling
at their weapons. Frailes prayed in the church.
Trusted neophytes carried water and cold food, and
stood by to handle ammunition when the time came.</p>

<p>Scouts had been sent out—a small number, since
the defenders of the mission were limited, but experienced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
men, both white and red, who could be depended
upon. A mile from the plaza, on every side,
they watched for the approach of the foe, ready to
sound the warning and then make their way in to aid
in the defence.</p>

<p>Hour after hour passed without event. The <i>comandante</i>
and Ensign Sanchez paced the plaza praying for
action, knowing their men could not endure the suspense
much longer without giving way to their feelings
and violating orders as to silence.</p>

<p>In the guest house, Señora Vallejo was upon her
knees like a pious woman, and Señorita Anita stood
beside a window looking out at the dark night, biting
her lower lip, clenching her tiny hands, and thinking
of the shame upon the name of Fernandez.</p>

<p>She half regretted that she had not come out openly
and told her padre the truth concerning Rojerio Rocha;
yet she had not, hoping against hope that something
would occur to prevent his perfidy becoming known.
Perhaps his Indians would turn upon him and everyone
think he had died a loyal man. Perhaps Captain
Fly-by-Night would perform the service he had
promised, and let the soul of Rojerio Rocha from his
body before he actually had engaged in shedding the
blood of good and loyal men.</p>

<p>Sergeant Cassara and Gonzales appeared to be the
only ones at the mission not bothered by the waiting.
They sat against the adobe wall in a corner, speaking
in whispers of other uprisings, jesting at times, Gonzales
recalling the days of his piracy and Cassara making
envious comments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</span></p>

<p>Midnight came, but no alarm had been given. Not
a sound broke the monotonous stillness of the night, yet
the quiet was in itself ominous. Frequently the <i>comandante</i>
and ensign stopped their pacing to look toward
the north, in the direction of San Luis Rey de Francia,
wondering what was transpiring there, half fearing to
see the glare of flames through the fog, conjecturing
as to the whereabouts of the Governor and his force.</p>

<p>Then a shot—far distant, toward the south! In an
instant every whispering voice was stilled, every man
was on his feet holding weapons ready. Just the one
shot, and then the ominous quiet again! Had some
scout fired at a shadow, at some animal moving over
the ground? Or, had he gone down to a quick death
as the shot was fired, and so could give no further
warning?</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed—then another shot came, this
time some distance to the right of the first. It was
answered by shrieks from half a hundred throats,
shrieks there could be no mistaking. A score of shots
sounded now, and the cries increased in volume.</p>

<p>At the mission there was many a sigh of relief—inaction
and uncertainty were at an end. Sergeant
Cassara got up from the ground, took a hitch at his
belt, and turned toward his friend.</p>

<p>“Well, old pirate, let us get to our gruesome business,”
he said. “A plague on these hostiles who have
no better sense than to assail men of our standing
and courage! Many I shall kill presently who would
have lived many years had they not listened to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
renegade. You take the left side, Señor Gonzales?
Very good!”</p>

<p>Now the scouts were running in, closely pursued,
and scattering shots came from three directions. Yet
the scouts stopped long enough to give the first surprise.</p>

<p>Around the mission at nightfall great heaps of dry
grass and wood had been piled, and now the men
running to the protection of wall and buildings stopped
on their way to set these piles afire. Instantly the
flames sprang up, illuminating the ground for a great
distance; and in the glare half-naked forms were revealed.</p>

<p>Gonzales fired the first shot, and a hostile fell. A
trooper cheered. A bedlam of sound answered him.
And then the roar of musketry broke out, and the
battle was on.</p>

<p>Charging redskins scattered the dangerous fires as
they advanced, scattered them so that the flames licked
at the dry grass and spread in a great circle around
the mission, giving the defenders greater advantage
than they had enjoyed before. The shrieking horde
seemed to be advancing from every side, oblivious of
their losses. Volleys of musket slugs were rained
against the wall and against the buildings. Clouds
of arrows fell.</p>

<p>But the defenders, settled now to their work, spent
no time in cheering, but shot methodically and with
good aim, cutting down the number of their foes,
crying now and then for ammunition, urging on comrades
in quiet tones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>A hundred of the thousand hostiles met death in the
first half-hour of the attack because of the fires that had
been set. But the nine hundred others rushed on, urged
by their chiefs, charging to the very walls, hurled back
again and again, but always returning to the charge.
Now the ground was dotted with dead and wounded
men.</p>

<p>Inside the plaza frailes were busy at surgery, for the
defenders had not escaped unscathed. Firebrands had
been thrown and extinguished. The first impulsive,
enthusiastic attack had failed.</p>

<p>The hostiles drew away, and the fires died out, and
the darkness descended again.</p>

<p>Now those inside the mission strained eyes to see
and ears to hear, trying to find shadows in the darkness,
firing now and then where it was believed an
enemy lurked. Every foot of the high adobe wall was
watched by keen eyes. The quick rustling of a bush in
the wind was the signal for half a score of shots. And
the only answer was silence—a menacing silence
charged with promise of death.</p>

<p>An hour passed, during which soldiers felt their
nerves at the breaking-point. Then a chorus of shrieks
assailed their ears, coming from a corner of the plaza.
A sudden rush, a fusillade that took toll of the defenders,
and then a hand-to-hand conflict where muskets
were dropped and knives and pistols used!</p>

<p>“Hah! Come on, hostiles!” the voice of Sergeant
Cassara roared. “Have at you, followers of a dog renegade!
Charge, will you? Cross blades with a sergeant
of Santa Barbara, eh? There, hound! There,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
cur! There, dog! Come on—more! Let us make a
quick end of it.”</p>

<p>“At them!” Gonzales was bellowing in his great
voice. “Make them walk the plank, the curs! String
them up at the yardarm! No quarter, wretches! Hah!
Try to split open an honest pirate with a blade, will
you? There, misguided imbecile!”</p>

<p>Dead and wounded Indians fell inside the wall. Determined
men ran from other parts of the plaza at the
<i>comandante’s</i> command. Foot by foot they cleared the
top of the wall, then caught up muskets and poured a
hot volley into the struggling, frenzied mass below.
Side by side, swords and poniards in their hands, they
held their places while the loyal neophytes behind them
reloaded muskets and pistols.</p>

<p>The hostiles were beaten back; they attacked at another
point. Like waves breaking against a rocky shore
they surged against wall and buildings and rolled away
again, leaving their dead and wounded behind.</p>

<p>They concentrated an attack against the storehouse,
trying to make a breach in the wall, and failed. They
battered at the windows of the church in vain. Always
strong adobe confronted them, every foot guarded by
determined men who shot cheerfully and well and
answered not at all to the frenzied cries, save by discharge
of firearms.</p>

<p>Again a retreat and an hour of quiet, and then
another rush at the corner of the adobe wall, a rush
more determined than the others, and that almost won
at the outset. Other parts of the plaza were left unprotected
as the entire strength of the garrison gathered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
to repulse the charge. Storehouse and church were
abandoned for a time, except for a few men in each
place to give alarm if a counter-attack was started.</p>

<p>The hostiles were driven back, but the defenders had
sustained heavy losses. There were dead white men
just inside the wall; three wounded troopers groaned
as they staggered across the plaza to receive medical aid;
and Sergeant Cassara howled maledictions upon renegades
and hostiles as Gonzales bandaged a bad cut in the
Santa Barbara soldier’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Save me my blood, good pirate!” he cried. “Stop
its flow, for the love of the saints, before I lose so much
that I am weakened! If I were to meet this Fly-by-Night
and had not the strength to stand up before
him——”</p>

<p>“Hah! I’ll attend to the renegade in your name and
my own, comrade!” Gonzales replied. “You can lose
twice this blood and still fight. ’Tis a clean cut and
soon will heal—just a mere prick in the skin. You have
been living too soft; in good condition you scarcely
would notice a slash like this. In my pirate days——”</p>

<p>“Spare me your pirate days!” Cassara cried. “A
mere prick in the skin, eh? Give me my blade!”</p>

<p>“It were best for you to rest here beside the wall for
the time being, comrade, and get back your strength.”</p>

<p>“My strength? A mere prick in the skin? Hah!
My blade, good pirate!”</p>

<p>A chorus of shrieks came from the wall; the hostiles
were attacking again. Gonzales turned and ran to his
place when he heard the <i>comandante</i> screeching orders.
Sergeant Cassara staggered to his feet, stood for a time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
with legs spread wide apart until he could walk without
reeling, then picked up blade and returned to the
combat.</p>

<p>Gonzales, firing and using blade by turns, realised
that the sergeant stood beside him again.</p>

<p>“Hah! At them, brave soldier!” he cried. “To your
right, man! That cur almost had you! Easy—easy!
You still are weak.”</p>

<p>“Prick in the skin!” Cassara hissed, and sent his
blade home again.</p>

<p>Another rush, and for a time the defenders of the
wall settled down to desperate work. The hostiles
seemed to be getting the better of it. Half a score of
times they broke over the wall, some to fall inside dead
and wounded, others to fall back before the infuriated
counter-assault of the defenders.</p>

<p>Cassara, cutting and slashing savagely, felt blood
flowing from his wound again and realised that he was
growing weak. A film seemed to be before his eyes,
his blows came not so frequent and swift.</p>

<p>“Hah! ’Ware on your left!” he heard Gonzales shout.</p>

<p>As through a screen the sergeant saw a giant hostile
swinging at him with a bludgeon. Cassara drew back
and swung his sword, but not in time to cut down his
enemy. He felt a terrific blow on the side of his head,
his senses reeled, and he fell backward off the wall with
the vengeful shriek of Gonzales ringing in his ears as
the pirate ran the hostile through.</p>

<p>For several minutes he remained huddled on the
ground while the fight raged about him, and then he
began crawling to one side, following the wall, trying to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
get where he would not hinder the others, and remain
away until he recovered strength.</p>

<p>Propped against the wall of the storehouse, he
watched the conflict on the other side of the plaza, too
weak to stand, his head swimming, scarcely able to lift
an arm. Shadow-shapes came and went before him;
the shrieks seemed far away.</p>

<p>“By the saints—!” he gasped. “A club—a club to
render me senseless! Carlos Cassara, who has stood
up to good fighters, to be beaten down by a common
club in the hands of a gentile cur! A mere club! Hah!
I shall go mad!”</p>

<p>He tried to wipe the film from in front of his eyes
and peer at the wall. It seemed to him that the shrieks
had redoubled, and he sensed that his comrades were
giving way before the onslaught of the enemy. He
tried to cry encouraging words, but merely made a
rattling noise in his throat.</p>

<p>“Mere—club—” he gasped.</p>

<p>Someone rushed before him. A firebrand fell in the
plaza—and by its momentary glare Cassara saw a man
standing with a pistol a score of feet away.</p>

<p>“Wha—what—?” he began mumbling. And then,
suddenly, realisation came to him. This man before
him was Captain Fly-by-Night, the renegade. He was
here, in the middle of the plaza! What did it mean?
Had the attack on the wall been a subterfuge? Had
hostiles invaded the church and now were attacking the
defenders in the rear?</p>

<p>Fear for his comrades clutched at the heart of Sergeant
Carlos Cassara. He gathered his remaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
strength and tried to stagger to his feet, but could not.
He still was sick because of the blow he had received,
and from loss of blood. Huddled beside the wall of
the storehouse, he drew air deep into his lungs, and
expelled it in a series of shouts that rang out above the
din of battle.</p>

<p>“Ho! Hah! Behind you, comrades! They are
behind you! Captain Fly-by-Night is in the plaza!”</p>

<p>The glare of the firebrand died out, and, as it died,
Cassara saw Fly-by-Night turn and face him for an
instant, glance back at the wall, then flee toward the
church and enter it.</p>

<p>“Behind you!” Cassara shouted again. “Fly-by-Night
behind you!”</p>

<p>Now some of the men had run from the wall and were
gathering around him, Gonzales at their head.</p>

<p>“He was—there! He ran into—the church!” Cassara
went on.</p>

<p>Roaring a challenge, Gonzales rushed across the plaza
with half a dozen men at his heels. Another firebrand
struck inside, and its glare revealed every corner. Gonzales
rushed into the church, weapons held ready. The
men with him searched every nook and corner, but none
was there except the two men left on guard. A soldier
ran for the firebrand and carried it into the church
contrary to orders; but its light revealed no renegade
crouching and ready for sword play or pistol shot.</p>

<p>Gonzales and his men hurried back to the plaza and
stood over Sergeant Cassara again.</p>

<p>“The blow on your head turned your wit,” the pirate
said. “You saw Fly-by-Night, eh?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<p>“I swear by the saints he stood before me, watching
you on the wall.”</p>

<p>“Take no oath by the saints until your head is
better, sergeant mine, else you perjure yourself. There
is no sight of the man in plaza or chapel—and the men
guarding the church saw no one.”</p>

<p>“I tell you he was here! <i>Dios!</i> Cannot a man
believe his own eyes?”</p>

<p>“’Twas your imagination. The blow caused you to
see this Fly-by-Night along with stars and meteors.”</p>

<p>“I saw him——”</p>

<p>“Then you saw a ghost!” Gonzales declared. “Rest
you easy, sergeant mine, and frighten us no more with
old women’s tales of hostiles at our back.”</p>

<p>“I tell you——”</p>

<p>“Tell it to the ghost if he comes again!” Gonzales
snorted; and hurried back to the wall, where the hostiles,
beaten off again, were retreating to prepare for another
assault.</p>

<p>Sergeant Cassara propped himself up against the wall
of the storehouse and gazed into the darkness, half
expecting the sound of a stealthy step near him. The
weakness came again, and his head sank forward. He
struggled in vain to keep his eyes open, keep his senses
alert. And just before he lapsed into unconsciousness
he gripped the hilt of his sword and moaned into the
night:</p>

<p>“I shall go mad! By the saints! I shall go mad!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX"><span class="tall-2">CHAPTER XX<br></span>

<span class="s8">ANOTHER VISITOR</span></h2>

<p>The dawn!</p>

<p>Some trooper started the cheer when the first
faint red streak began to show through the fog,
and the others took it up, until all the defenders
at the mission were hailing the day except the frailes
busy with their prayers.</p>

<p>The dawn meant that no more could the hostiles
approach under cover of darkness, make unexpected
attacks in certain quarters, or slip up unnoticed until
within a few feet of the walls. Now they could be
observed easily on every side, and an open charge could
be met by a concentrated defence.</p>

<p>As the day broadened and the fog began to lift a
constant pattering of musket slugs beat against the
walls, and flaming arrows were still being discharged.
Neophytes carried food and water and wine to the men
on the wall and at the windows of the buildings, and
they ate and drank as they fought, trying to pick off
enemies when head or leg or arm showed.</p>

<p>Every boulder had a hostile behind it, every pile of
debris, and they were intrenched behind the wall of the
orchard, from which comparative security they showered
bullets against those of the mission.</p>

<p>Dead and wounded gentiles and traitorous neophytes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
dotted the ground on every side of the plaza. Eight
defenders were stretched in a row near the wall, victims
of the conspiracy. More than a score wounded had
been quartered in the church, where the frailes attended
to their injuries as well as they could, for the church
was where the last stand would be made if necessary.</p>

<p>A nervous, anxious <i>comandante</i> paced the plaza,
scarcely speaking to his men. Ensign Sanchez, from a
position near the end of the wall, had glass to eye,
searching El Camino Real for a cloud of dust that
would tell of the approach of the Governor and his
force, fearing as he looked that it would not be possible
for his excellency to arrive until the end of the day.</p>

<p>A great deal depended on what had transpired at
San Luis Rey de Francia. There was a chance the
Governor would have to stop and give aid there and
could not continue to San Diego de Alcalá. It was
certain the hostiles knew the Governor was coming, and
would attempt to gain possession of the mission before
his arrival.</p>

<p>Sergeant Cassara still sat against the wall of the
storehouse, and Gonzales, down on his knees beside him,
was holding a wine cup while the sergeant drank. Gonzales
had suffered a minor wound, but made little of it.</p>

<p>“Together, we have not lost enough blood to dye
a lady’s handkerchief,” he said. “’Twas the knock
on the head made you faint, sergeant mine.”</p>

<p>“Carlos Cassara to be knocked on the head with a
club!” the sergeant groaned. “I shall go mad!”</p>

<p>“Another man would have had his skull crushed by
the blow. How feel you now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span></p>

<p>“Excellent well, good pirate, except my neck be so
stiff I cannot turn my head.”</p>

<p>“Hah! Dost want to look behind you to pick out
a way to run?”</p>

<p>“Now, by all the saints——”</p>

<p>“’Twas but a jest, Carlos, my friend. You are able
to fight again?”</p>

<p>“Let the dogs but attack and I’ll take my place
beside you,” the sergeant boasted.</p>

<p>“You have seen no more ghosts?”</p>

<p>“’Twas no ghost! ’Twas Captain Fly-by-Night himself,
may the imps of evil seize upon him! Laugh, and
you like! I saw him, by the light of the firebrand,
standing in the plaza, pistol in hand.”</p>

<p>“We’ll say no more of it,” Gonzales proposed. “’Tis
no thing to cause argument between friends. What is
a ghost? Hah!”</p>

<p>The door of the guest house was thrown open, and
the giant Pedro stalked out, followed by Señorita Anita
Fernandez and Señora Vallejo. It was plain to be seen
both women had been weeping. The <i>comandante</i>
hurried toward them, cap in hand, and spoke with them
for a few moments, then conducted them along the wall
toward the church.</p>

<p>“Displaying the women folk,” Cassara whispered to
his friend. “’Twill make the men fight better. What
a girl that is!”</p>

<p>“’Twere hard to die as this Rojerio Rocha died,
knowing death robbed him of such treasure,” Gonzales
replied.</p>

<p>“He is dead, then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>“It is assumed so. Why would hostiles hold him
prisoner when they are running wild to kill other good
men?”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t they slay him at the rancho with Señor
Lopez and the others? Answer me that!” said Cassara.
“How does it happen this Fly-by-Night got the women
from the ranch-house and fetched them here? Answer
me that! Why does this girl gasp and say it is too
horrible, yet give no details? Reply to me concerning
that! Hah! When this row is at an end there’ll be
explanations enough to occupy a year of his excellency’s
time!”</p>

<p>“The women are going into the church to pray,”
Gonzales announced, for lack of anything better to say.
“’Tis well. As for me, I do my praying as I fight.
It is an excellent custom. I noticed a fray as dawn
broke doing the same thing. Load and fire—then on
his knees—arise—load and fire again. He kept it up
for half an hour.”</p>

<p>“The bells of the mission rang as usual this morning,
I noticed,” Gonzales said.</p>

<p>“And did you hear the fiends yell and double their
volleys at the same time? Hah! Drown the sound
of mission bells by shrieks and shouts? They’ll ring
down the centuries, my good pirate—ring either in
fact or fancy as long as two chunks of adobe cling together!
Hah! I grow poetical, pirate! Is it a sign of
approaching death?”</p>

<p>“It is a sign of approaching lunacy,” Gonzales
answered, and stood to his feet to watch Señorita Anita
and her <i>duenna</i> as they came from the church and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
crossed the plaza to the guest house again, heads bowed
and hands clasped, a fray behind them, the <i>comandante</i>
hovering near.</p>

<p>The crest of the hill behind the mission flamed red
suddenly as a volley was fired. The cries of the
besiegers were redoubled. The <i>comandante</i> and the
ensign called commands. Gonzales picked up musket
and hurried to the wall, and Sergeant Cassara got
slowly upon his feet, balanced himself dazedly against
the storehouse wall for a moment, then clutched his
own musket and staggered weakly after his friend.</p>

<p>From all sides came the rain of bullets, while over
the crest of the hill poured charging hostiles in a mad
rush toward the plaza. Others remained at the crest
and covered the charge with volleys, keeping the top of
the wall clear until those concerned in the assault were
within striking distance.</p>

<p>Then the top of the wall burst into flame, and the
charge hesitated for an instant, recoiled, gathered
courage and continued. Once more hostiles and defenders
fought hand-to-hand with pistols and swords
and knives.</p>

<p>More dead were stretched beside the wall inside the
plaza, more dotted the ground outside. Additional
wounded shrieked or groaned in pain. Half a dozen
savages invaded the plaza, to be caught in a corner
as in a trap and exterminated. The assault failed,
as had the previous ones, but it had proved costly to
the defenders.</p>

<p>Now there was quiet for an hour, except for the
continual shots fired by hostiles under cover. Frailes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
worked frantically with the wounded. More ammunition
was distributed. Ensign Sanchez swept El Camino
Real with his glass, and turned away disconsolate. The
<i>comandante</i> walked from post to post, cheering his
men, his face contradicting the words he spoke.</p>

<p>“A few more charges like that,” Gonzales was
saying, “and there’ll not be enough of us left to make a
defence. No gentile had brains enough to cover an
advance from the crest like that. Hah! If ever I
meet this renegade who leads them——”</p>

<p>“The mere thought of standing before him makes
me strong again,” Cassara replied. “I pray both of
us will have pistols empty and be forced to use naked
steel.”</p>

<p>A fusillade interrupted him, a renewal of war cries
smote the ears of those in the plaza. Men raised
weapons to fire, expecting another charge. And over
the crest of the hill fled a man who waved a white
cloth above his head and plunged down toward the
mission.</p>

<p>“A white man! Don’t fire! A white man!” <i>comandante</i>
and ensign were shouting.</p>

<p>Now the crest was alive with Indians, who fired
repeatedly at the fleeing figure. Some gave chase
until bullets from the wall cut them down. On and
on raced the fugitive toward the promised shelter of
the mission.</p>

<p>“’Tis this Rojerio Rocha!” Cassara shouted.</p>
</div>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI"><span class="tall-2">CHAPTER XXI<br></span>

<span class="s8">IN THE GUEST HOUSE</span></h2>

<p>“Rojerio Rocha! He has escaped them!”
Others took up the cry, and cheers from those
along the wall greeted the flying man, cheers of
welcome and encouragement. The Indians on the
crest were still firing at him. He dodged from side
to side as he ran. Now he dropped the white cloth
he had carried, glued elbows to his sides, and ran on.
He stumbled, fell, regained his feet.</p>

<p>“Help him!” the <i>comandante</i> cried. “Aid him inside,
you men!”</p>

<p>The fugitive crashed against the wall. A musket
was let down, and he grasped it, and they pulled him up
and lifted him over—to see him collapse on the ground
breathless, his eyes rolling, clutching at the breast of
his cloak as if it pained him to try to breathe.</p>

<p>“He has been hit!” a fray cried; but the man shook
his head. They gave him wine, and he drank, and
gasped until he got his breath.</p>

<p>“The fiends!” he cursed. “They were holding me—expected
to torture me—with Señorita Fernandez—said
her father—had been cruel. I managed—to get
free of bonds. They will—attack again!”</p>

<p>Even as he spoke the second attack came. Again a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
throng of savages rushed down the slope while others
poured a volley at the wall. The hostiles in the orchard
joined in the charge.</p>

<p>They reached the corner of the wall, piled against
it, made their way upward in the face of musket flashes
and blades. Shrieking chiefs urged them on. One by
one the defenders crashed to the ground inside. The
ranks closed up. All other parts of the square were
abandoned as men rushed to the threatened corner.
The man who had escaped the hostiles was forgotten.</p>

<p>He got upon his feet and stood against the wall for
a moment, clutching at his breast as if it still pained
him to breathe, and then he tottered toward the storehouse.
A jug of water was on the step, and he lifted
it and drank, then staggered inside.</p>

<p>One soldier had remained there to guard, and was
standing at the wide window, musket ready, prepared
to fire and give an alarm if the Indians attempted to
gain entrance there. He whirled around as the other
man stumbled against a counter.</p>

<p>“Thank the saints you escaped!” he cried. “It was
a close call, Señor Rocha.”</p>

<p>“A musket,” the other demanded. “Weapon and
ammunition! Am I to stand by idly while others
fight?”</p>

<p>The soldier got a musket from the corner and handed
it over, and turned for powder and ball. The man
behind him swung the heavy weapon over his head
and crashed it down on the soldier’s skull, and the storehouse
guard was stretched on the floor.</p>

<p>It did not seem to pain him to breathe now, for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
was done with acting. He hurried across to the window
and worked frantically to unfasten the bars. For
an instant he leaned out and waved a cloth.</p>

<p>A group of hostiles beside the orchard wall had
been waiting for that signal. Now they ran wildly
across the open space—a score of them—some falling
on the way, men from other groups of hostiles joining
them. Shrieking their battle-cries, they poured through
the window the renegade had opened and plunged into
the plaza.</p>

<p>At the same time hostiles swarmed over the end of
the wall, enough of them to make a stand. Beset
front and rear, the defenders stood back to back and
fought courageously. More men fell. Loyal neophytes
had been slain as they loaded weapons; and there was
no time for the remaining defenders to load now, nothing
to do except use muskets as clubs, hurl pistols in
savage faces, and wield swords and poniards.</p>

<p>“The women—the church!” the <i>comandante</i> shrieked
to a fray.</p>

<p>It was the first admission that conditions were
serious. The fray bowed his head and joined another,
and they hurried across the plaza to the guest house,
where Señora Vallejo was praying in a corner and
Señorita Anita standing at a window watching the
combat, a knife clutched in one hand.</p>

<p>“Quick—the church—it is the last stand!” one of
the frailes cried.</p>

<p>The <i>señora</i> got up and hurried to the door, grasping
at a fray’s arm, tears streaming down her cheeks.</p>

<p>“<i>Señorita</i>,” the fray called.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>“I remain here,” she said.</p>

<p>“The <i>comandante</i> has said you must go to the
church.”</p>

<p>“I remain here!”</p>

<p>In her brain was beating the sentence the caballero
had spoken—that she was to remain in the guest house,
no matter what transpired. She was not certain the
words had not been a boast. She could not imagine
how a rescue could be made, though she had reason to
know he was clever at rescue work, unless he led the
hostiles and intended to save her after the mission had
been taken. But she remembered, too, how he had
declared he was no traitor, and believed in her heart
he had spoken truth.</p>

<p>“This is madness!” one of the frailes cried.</p>

<p>“Go! I remain here!” she answered.</p>

<p>“We must make haste. I’ll return for you, <i>señorita</i>!”</p>

<p>The frailes hurried outside with the <i>señora</i> and ran
across to the church. The defenders were retreating
across the plaza now, fighting every foot of the way,
backing sullenly but hopelessly and attempting to carry
their wounded with them.</p>

<p>Looking out of the window, Señorita Anita Fernandez
knew in her heart that the frailes would never
be able to return across the plaza for her—that hostiles
would be in front of the guest house before they had
placed Señora Vallejo inside the church.</p>

<p>She drew back from the window, still clutching the
poniard. She could not feel much faith in the caballero;
saw naught but death before her. Death self-inflicted
if hostiles invaded the guest house and started<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
to take her prisoner! Death if the caballero appeared
with mask thrown aside and as leader of the hostiles
after all! Death if he did not appear and the traitorous
Rojerio Rocha did, and attempted to claim her
as bride! Death—naught but death!</p>

<p>She rushed to the window again and saw that the
defenders had been driven back to the door of the
church. The plaza was filled with shrieking hostiles.
Muskets crashed, steel rang. Dead men and wounded
men were scattered over the ground. The storehouse
was being looted even now.</p>

<p>Again she crept back near the fireplace in the wall,
and her lips moved in prayer. The door was thrown
open, and she made the poniard ready, for it was an
Indian who stood framed in it for an instant. Then
she gave a glad cry—the Indian was Pedro, the faithful
servant.</p>

<p>But the cry died in her throat as she remembered
that there was a possibility that even Pedro had turned
hostile now that men of his race were victors. She
gazed wide-eyed as he half closed the door and faced
her.</p>

<p>“I have come for you, <i>señorita</i>,” he said. “I noticed
you did not go to the church with the <i>señora</i> and others.
But we cannot cross the plaza now, for it is full of
hostiles. We must remain here—and I can die beside
you, <i>señorita</i>!”</p>

<p>He turned to close the door and lift the heavy bar
across it, but it was hurled wide open against him,
sending him recoiling against the wall, and another
entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span></p>

<p>“You?” Señorita Anita gasped. “You—Rojerio
Rocha!”</p>

<p>He made no answer, scarcely looked at her. Whirling
upon the neophyte he pointed toward the open
door.</p>

<p>“Out!” he commanded.</p>

<p>For an instant the Indian seemed to flinch with fear;
then courage returned to him, for he thought the man
before him misunderstood.</p>

<p>“I am no hostile,” he said proudly. “I came to help
protect the Señorita Anita. Ask her if I have offered
harm.”</p>

<p>“Out!” came the command again.</p>

<p>“I am loyal. The hostiles will slay me!”</p>

<p>“Go out, I say!”</p>

<p>The man’s manner seemed to flash a warning to the
neophyte. He turned swiftly and glanced at the
<i>señorita</i>, and observed that she was clutching the
poniard and staring at the man in horror.</p>

<p>“If the <i>señorita</i> commands—” the neophyte began.</p>

<p>“Will you go out, dog?”</p>

<p>“No—no, Pedro!” the girl implored. “This
man——”</p>

<p>But the roar of rage from the throat of the white
man drowned the remainder of her sentence, and the
neophyte did not hear. Standing against the wall he
beheld the other man bearing down upon him with
poniard ready.</p>

<p>“I am loyal!” he cried. “I will help you! You do
not understand! I am Pedro, and I have——”</p>

<p>A hand clutched at his throat, the point of the blade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
was at his breast. He was hurled to the doorway,
staggered, stumbled when the other man threw weight
against him.</p>

<p>“Here is a loyal man—attend to him!” he heard his
antagonist shriek.</p>

<p>Then he fell full length into the plaza, and shrieking
hostiles rushed upon him.</p>

<p>“Do not—understand!” he gasped; and died from
a pistol shot.</p>

<p>And a laughing renegade hurled the door shut, barred
it securely, and still laughing turned to face the terror-stricken
girl crouching at the corner of the big fireplace.</p>

<span class="s8">“COMMAND ME, SEÑORITA!”</span></h2>

<p>He ignored her a moment longer, running to
the window and looking out across the plaza.
The doors of the church were closed, but from
the windows streamed hot lead, and from all parts of
the plaza, and from the rear outside, hostiles were firing
at every aperture.</p>

<p>“’Twill not last much longer,” he said, laughing
again, and then turned from the window and confronted
the girl.</p>

<p>“So you escaped the rancho?” he went on. “Very
clever of you, <i>señorita</i>, though I cannot imagine why
you should leave security and come to this place, where
there has been grave danger. You may be glad to know
that your escape caused three Indian guards to lose their
lives. I had promised them death if you evaded them,
and I always keep my promises. I handed them over
to their chiefs—it was enough.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Her cry was of horror, pity, loathing, a
world of expression in a single syllable.</p>

<p>“We investigated the fireplace and chimney, and
found an open window,” he continued. “It was beyond
me that you and your <i>duenna</i> could open the chimney
in that manner, for I thought at first, of course, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
you had done so. Then I remembered the stampede
of horses, knew you must have had a mount to make
the journey to the mission, and realised there was help
from another source. Who aided you, <i>señorita</i>?”</p>

<p>“A gambler, swindler and thief, a wronger of women
and a worthless vagabond, according to the world’s
estimate of him,” she replied. “Yet a man beside whom
you are not worthy to crawl, Rojerio Rocha, despite
the blood that flows in your veins.”</p>

<p>“I can imagine but one such contradictory paragon.
So it was this man you call Captain Fly-by-Night?”</p>

<p>“It was, <i>señor</i>.”</p>

<p>“Did Señorita Anita Fernandez so far forget herself
as to ride through the night, even with her <i>duenna</i>, in
company with such a character?” he sneered. “I had
it in mind to wed you, <i>señorita</i>, but if you have been
consorting with such persons——”</p>

<p>“<i>Señor!</i>” she cried angrily, her face aflame.</p>

<p>“That touches you, does it? However, I am master
now. As you are aware, the revolt has almost made a
winning here at San Diego de Alcalá. Another quarter
hour and my hostiles will be inside that church and
attend to their enemies. An hour, and the mission and
presidio will be black ruins, and we return to the rancho
for a wedding feast and honeymoon, <i>señorita</i> mine. So
your escape availed you nothing. Did you hope to
escape me again by remaining in the guest house while
the others fled into the church? Or, perhaps, did you
hope I’d find you here, alone?”</p>

<p>“Renegade!” she taunted.</p>

<p>“Hard names do not injure me, <i>señorita</i>, in the hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
of my success; and, as I told you before, you are
beautiful when aroused and angry. ’Twas a pretty fight
your friends put up here at the mission, and cost us
many men, but there was only one end possible. Have
you heard of my exploit, <i>señorita</i>? And that reminds
me—I was accepted as a friend by the men in the plaza,
so you must not have told them of our little interview
out at the rancho.”</p>

<p>“I told them nothing,” she said.</p>

<p>“Hah! You had that much affection for me, then?
You loved your family name that much?”</p>

<p>“But I regret now that I did not,” she answered.</p>

<p>“It would have been the same had you told. It was
a great trick we played. Hah! Like fools they
swallowed the bait. I broke over the hill and ran, with
hostiles pursuing and firing at me. Those at the wall
helped me inside, and I gasped out that I had been held
for torture and had made my escape. It was a pretty
bit of acting, I assure you. Then another attack—and
while all were busy it was an easy matter to slip into the
storehouse, put the guard out of the way and throw
open the window. In my friends tumbled—to take the
defenders in the rear. Poor fools!”</p>

<p>“I would to God I had told them!” she cried.</p>

<p>“But you did not, eh? Why not make the best of
matters, <i>señorita</i>? I am master and I have said you
are to be my bride. Why not surrender gracefully,
when there is nothing else left to do?”</p>

<p>“There is something else left to do,” she answered.
“There always is death waiting.”</p>

<p>Now she stood up and faced him, and he saw that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
she clutched a poniard in her hand. The terror had
gone out of her face, and in its place was cool determination.
Her lips were set tightly, her bosom heaved
with emotion. There was no doubt in the mind of the
man that the girl before him would plunge that knife
into her heart. He knew the proud breed of the Fernandez.</p>

<p>“There is always death, and it will be welcome,” she
went on. “Why should I live? Do you think, Rojerio
Rocha, you ever could claim me for wife? Do you
think I would mate with a renegade murderer whose
hands are stained with loyal blood? Can I live, even
if I escape you, with the knowledge that men and
women know one of my family has done such a thing?”</p>

<p>“If such a thing as escape were possible, you could,”
he returned, lightly. “Unless you have told them,
none here knows I have turned traitor, <i>señorita</i> mine.
They have been too busy to watch or question me since
they aided me over the wall. And in a few minutes all
will be dead, since that is the better way, and dead
people do not talk of treason.” A pause. “But escape
is not possible.”</p>

<p>“Then—this—” She lifted the poniard again.</p>

<p>“So you would slay yourself, eh? You are young
and beautiful to die, <i>señorita</i>. It is a foolish whim.”</p>

<p>He did not take his eyes from hers. He knew she
would drive the dagger home if he attempted to
approach. Before he could reach her side and take the
weapon from her, she would thrust it into her breast.
He did not doubt it for an instant.</p>

<p>He tried to think of a subterfuge to get her close to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
him, so he could tear the poniard from her hand. If
he could make her angry, so she would attack him, it
might be possible.</p>

<p>“Were this man you call Fly-by-Night here in my
stead, <i>señorita</i>,” he sneered, “I presume you would drop
dagger and rush into his arms. You speak of a stain
on the family name—when you have allowed such a
man to rescue you, have ridden the miles between rancho
and mission in his arms, perhaps——”</p>

<p>Her face flamed again, and he laughed scornfully.</p>

<p>“Captain Fly-by-Night acted the gentleman and
caballero,” she replied hotly. “That is more than you
have done, Rojerio Rocha.”</p>

<p>“You look upon me with hatred, and upon this fellow
with eyes of love, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“<i>Señor!</i> It is like you to insult a defenceless girl!
Did I have to give love to one of you, most assuredly
it would be this man of whom you sneer. For you
are as far below him, Rojerio Rocha, as the land is
below the sky; and, knowing how low he is considered,
that speaks my estimation for you!”</p>

<p>“A stain on the family name, eh?” he laughed scornfully.
“I put it there, eh? What about you, Señorita
Anita? So proud of your good blood and your family
honour, so ready to die because they have been besmirched,
eh? Hah! If there is stain upon blood and
name, perhaps you have placed it there!”</p>

<p>He had gained his purpose now. She gave a cry of
rage and rushed upon him, poniard lifted to strike. He
seemed to recoil in sudden panic as she lunged toward
him, then quickly turned to one side and darted forward.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
She guessed his trick then, and swung her arm
to turn the blade against her own bosom.</p>

<p>But her arm was caught half-way and twisted so
cruelly that the weapon clattered to the floor, she felt
herself clasped to him, felt his breath on her face, heard
his laughter ringing in her ears.</p>

<p>Then his kisses rained upon her face, as she twisted
her head in an effectual effort to escape them. Shame
and rage flamed in her cheeks and throat. She
screamed, kicked, tried to free hands and hold him off,
and always he laughed and kissed her more, and finally
held her securely in his arms and looked down at her,
while her eyes blazed with hatred and loathing.</p>

<p>“A pretty tigress!” he cried. “’Twill be a pleasant
task to tame you, my sweet one, but tamed you shall
be. How like you to rest in my arms, eh? Are they
not as strong and at the same time as soft as those
of this Captain Fly-by-Night? Struggle, pretty one!
The sooner will you be exhausted. Come with me to
the window, queen-to-be, and watch the culmination of
the assault!”</p>

<p>He lifted her from the floor and carried her across
the room while she fought to be free. He held her there
at the window, held her hands so she could not cover
her eyes and laughed when he saw that her eyes were
closed.</p>

<p>“You’ll not look?” he said. “Then I’ll relate,
<i>señorita</i> mine. Just now my men are battering at the
church doors while others pour volleys into the windows
to drive fear to the hearts of the defenders. Five
minutes more, perhaps, and the fighting will be at an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
end. I have told the men to save me one padre. There
will be an immediate marriage, <i>señorita</i>——”</p>

<p>“Never will I be wed to you!” she cried. “No padre
will say the words!”</p>

<p>“He reads the ceremony or dies, <i>señorita</i>. Save his
life or not, as you please; by telling him you are willing
you will save it. And then, if he refuses to speak the
words— Hah! Ceremony or no ceremony, <i>señorita</i>——”</p>

<p>She twisted from his arms and dashed away, but
before she could reach the poniard on the floor he had
put a foot upon it, and standing there he laughed at her
again. Shrieks came from the plaza as the hostiles
battered in the doors of the church. The cracking of
flames told that some of the buildings were being
destroyed. But the man in the guest house had attention
for nothing except the girl who stood before him
panting in fear and anger.</p>

<p>“Resistance avails you naught,” he said. “Be
sensible, my pretty <i>señorita</i>; agree to what I say.”</p>

<p>Terror clutched her now; whimpering, she crouched
at the end of the fireplace.</p>

<p>“Even death is denied me!” she cried. “Is there
no escape?”</p>

<p>“None, <i>señorita</i>, except by becoming my bride.”</p>

<p>“Never that—renegade, murderer, traitor! If, in
all the wide world, there was but one honest man to aid
me now——”</p>

<p>A deep voice interrupted from a corner of the room:</p>

<p>“Command <i>me</i>, <i>señorita</i>!”</p>

<span class="s8">LOVE IN DARKNESS</span></h2>

<p>The hand of the girl’s tormentor flew to the hilt
of his poniard as he whirled toward the sound.
Anita gave a cry of relief and gladness, and
then stared with bulging eyes toward the corner.</p>

<p>An aperture had appeared in the wall there, and Captain
Fly-by-Night was standing just before it, bowing.</p>

<p>Now he raised his head and advanced two steps, and
his blazing eyes met those of the other man. It
seemed to the girl crouching at the end of the fireplace
that the caballero’s shoulders grew broader and that he
grew in height. His clothing was covered with dirt,
the beard on his face was scraggy, there were deep
hollows in his cheeks and dark circles under his eyes—yet
Señorita Anita thought him handsome now as he
confronted the man who had insulted her.</p>

<p>“Hah! ’Tis Claudio again!” sneered the raging
man in the centre of the room.</p>

<p>“You call yourself Rojerio Rocha, I believe,” came
the answer. “I am happy to find you here, <i>señor</i>. I
have promised to slay you.”</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>“To send your black soul to the Hades where it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
belongs,” the caballero continued. “Men have died to-day
because you plotted—better men than you! You
have broken faith with friends, betrayed those who have
been near you, swindled, lied, insulted helpless women,
sent human beings to agonising death——”</p>

<p>“Enough! This from a man known as Captain Fly-by-Night,
a man hunted by soldiers and hostiles alike?
I have but to open the door, my fine caballero, and some
of these same hostiles will finish you in the twinkling
of an eye. You hear those shrieks, caballero? They
mean the hostiles have gained entrance to the church—that
I am master—that I have won!”</p>

<p>“And in the hour of your hellish victory, you are to
die! I have promised it!... <i>Señorita</i>, will you
kindly step through this hole in the wall? There will
be happenings here women’s eyes should not see.”</p>

<p>“I want—to see,” she gasped.</p>

<p>“I appreciate your feelings in the matter, <i>señorita</i>,”
the caballero replied, bowing again. “Do you remain in
the corner, then, out of the way.... As for you,
<i>señor</i>, I notice you did not carry sword with you when
you pretended an escape and reached sanctuary in the
mission. But there is a poniard in your belt, and
another on the floor beneath your foot. So it shall be
poniards, <i>señor</i>!”</p>

<p>As he spoke, he took off his sword and threw it in the
corner behind him, took dagger from his belt, and advanced
two steps more with coolness and deliberation,
as if he had been treading the measure of a dance. The
man before him retreated, still clutching at his belt.</p>

<p>“’Tis like you,” he cried, “to fight a wounded man.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
Think you the slash you gave me in the shoulder has
healed?”</p>

<p>“As to that, we are on equal terms,” the caballero
announced. “I carry in my shoulder a musket slug no
surgeon has had chance to remove, given me by one
of your sentinels.”</p>

<p>“And why should I fight with you?” the other
demanded. “A victorious general does not cross blades
with a fugitive. One call from the door and you are
undone!”</p>

<p>Two quick steps he took toward the door, as if to let
down the bar and throw it open to call.</p>

<p>“Stop!” the caballero commanded. “If for no other
reason, you should fight with me to show you are not a
coward, <i>señor</i>. This lady, too, has called for assistance,
and I have responded. Seek not to delay me until your
men come from the church in search of you. You fight,
else die with knife in back like a common cur!”</p>

<p>The other whirled toward him, snarling; their wrists
crashed together.</p>

<p>They swerved and twisted, trying to gain advantage,
the caballero silent and deliberate as he went about his
business of killing this man who mouthed curses.
Thrice around the room they circled, while the girl
crouched in the corner, clasped hands to her breast and
breathed deeply and watched from narrowed eyes.</p>

<p>“If you have prayers to say, renegade, say them
now!” the caballero shouted. “Rojerio Rocha, scion
of a noble family—you! In a moment we shall see
whether your blood is blue. You have committed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
enough crimes to merit ten deaths, yet I can cause you
but one!”</p>

<p>They separated for an instant, clashed again. The
caballero spoke no more, and the watching girl saw
that his face was white and that he bit at his lip and
seemed to be growing weak. For the wound in his
shoulder was paining, and he was struggling to keep
the film from before his eyes, conserving strength for
the final effort. His antagonist sensed the advantage
and pressed the fighting. A cry of fear for the caballero
came from the girl’s throat.</p>

<p>But he was not to be defeated yet. He braced himself
and assumed the aggressive once more, and again
they fought to the centre of the room. Now fear
clutched at the heart of the caballero’s antagonist, and
he showed his craven spirit and love of unfairness.</p>

<p>“Ho!” he shrieked, to be heard above the din of
battle in the plaza. “To the rescue! Hostiles! Your
general is being slain! To the rescue!”</p>

<p>A wounded man sitting before the door heard him
and spread the alarm. A score of hostiles left the
church and ran across the plaza to peer through the
window of the guest house. They had been told not to
enter there, but what they saw caused them to disregard
their orders. In an instant they were battering at the
door and shrieking to their comrades.</p>

<p>They appeared at the windows, some of them holding
muskets ready to fire, but they dared not for fear
of sending a bullet to the heart of their leader. Purposely,
the caballero circled so that his enemy was
between him and the windows; and now, feeling his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
strength going, half sick because of the pain his shoulder
gave him, he attempted a quick end to the combat.</p>

<p>There flashed through his mind what fate was in
store for the <i>señorita</i> if he went down before this man.
He remembered other things, too, that gave him an
unnatural strength.</p>

<p>“The hole in the wall—get to the hole in the wall,”
he cried to the girl; and she glided past the fireplace, not
taking her eyes from the combatants an instant, until
she stood where he had commanded.</p>

<p>A heavy timber was being crashed against the door
now. Hostiles had left the windows to help break in.
The caballero fell back toward the aperture, gasping,
half reeling, blood flowing from cuts on his forearm.
He staggered, and his antagonist rushed.</p>

<p>And then they were locked in each other’s arms for
an instant while the caballero, calling upon all his remaining
strength, bent the other man backward, broke
his hold, drove home the knife!...</p>

<p>He stepped back, and the body of the other crashed
to the floor. There was no question of the man’s death,
for the caballero knew his poniard had found the heart.</p>

<p>Reeling toward the corner, as the heavy door began
to splinter, hearing the cries of the girl in his ears as
she begged him to make haste, he stopped an instant to
pick up his sword from the floor. And then he was by
her side, and she was half supporting him with her
arms, and the big door fell with a crash to let a score
of hostiles pour over it into the guest house.</p>

<p>A flash of flame—a bullet struck the wall within a
foot of his head!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span></p>

<p>The caballero laughed wildly, hurled his poniard at
the nearest Indian, stumbled into the dark tunnel and
swung shut the section of the wall. They could hear
the hostiles crashing against it on the other side.</p>

<p>They could not see each other in the darkness, yet
Señorita Anita guessed that he was bowing before her;
and there was the ring of proud victory in his voice
when he spoke:</p>

<p>“<i>Señorita</i>, I have kept my promise—I have slain this
man you called Rojerio Rocha. ’Ware my arm—it is
wet! Perspiration—again—<i>señorita</i>!”</p>

<p>Quiet in the tunnel for a moment, save for the caballero’s
heavy breathing and the girl’s gasps, as she still
clung to his arm while he leaned against the dirt wall
trying to recover breath and strength.</p>

<p>In the guest house the hostiles were shrieking news
of the fact that their leader had been slain, and telling
by whom, and screeches of rage came from them as they
hammered against the strong adobe wall, some searching
in vain for a way of opening the aperture, others
doubting whether the aperture had been there. Some,
superstitious, began to creep away, thinking there was a
ghost somewhere in this business.</p>

<p>They could hear, too, the roaring of flames from the
burning buildings, and the volleys of shots continued,
showing that the defenders of the mission still kept
up the unequal battle.</p>

<p>“You saved me—saved me,” Anita was breathing.</p>

<p>“I merely kept my promise, <i>señorita</i>. Thank you for
remaining in the guest house—for your faith in my
words.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span></p>

<p>“Yet I doubted at times,” she said.</p>

<p>“No more than natural, since the words were spoken
by such a worthless being as myself.”</p>

<p>“Call yourself worthless no longer!” the girl exclaimed.
“Men must have told falsehoods concerning
you. I cannot believe Captain Fly-by-Night to be the
man they say.”</p>

<p>“Worthless compared to yourself, at least, <i>señorita</i>.
Made better perhaps by my sudden love for you! But
I must not speak of that, since you will think I insult
you again.”</p>

<p>“Ah, it is not an insult now. Have you not saved
me?”</p>

<p>“I do not ask love as a reward for service, <i>señorita</i>.
And—I am strong again now, and we must be going.”</p>

<p>“Where?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Through this tunnel, though I scarcely know which
way to go. The hostiles may open that hole in the wall
soon, then this will be no safe place for us. I hope I
have not saved you to have you placed in danger again.”
He put an arm around her—nor did she protest—and
led her slowly along the narrow cut in the earth, trying
to shield her from falling dirt. Where the tunnel
branched, he stopped.</p>

<p>“That way leads to the well in the orchard,” he said.
“We dare not go there now, for the hostiles would see
us. This leads to the mortuary chapel of the mission,
a place that can be defended against both sides, <i>señorita</i>.
I think it would be the better place. If I must die,
where more appropriate than in a mortuary chapel, eh?”</p>

<p>“Do not speak of dying,” she said. “You must live!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span></p>

<p>“Had I something for which to live——!”</p>

<p>“More than I have,” she replied. “What is there in
the future for me? Where is there escape from this
present predicament? Where can Anita Fernandez
hold up her head, even if she escaped, since all will know
one of her blood did this thing?”</p>

<p>“Think of your own sweet character, <i>señorita</i>! The
faults of another cannot change that. You must live—live!
We will make our way to the chapel, and please
the saints I can hold it until the Governor comes! I
pray he arrives soon, else he will find nothing but ruins
and dead men.”</p>

<p>“If he does not come—? If he stops at San Luis
Rey de Francia to give aid there——?”</p>

<p>“Then perhaps we are lost,” the caballero replied.</p>

<p>“You will not let them take me. You will slay me
first?”</p>

<p>“You ask me to kill the thing I love,” he said. “Yet
my love is great enough, I think, to do even that to
save you from a worse fate. I promise, <i>señorita</i>. Yet
I pray nothing of the sort will be necessary. I pray
the Governor comes, and I can save you until then, and
hand you over to him safely.”</p>

<p>“And—yourself—?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I am not concerned about myself. Life means
nothing to me, <i>señorita</i>, when it does not hold your
affection. Ah, do not turn away——”</p>

<p>“I am not turning away.”</p>

<p>“You have called me gambler, swindler, wronger of
women. I swear I am not the last, <i>señorita</i>, nor have
I ever swindled a man. Yet I am the notorious Captain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
Fly-by-Night, you say. I made a foolish boast that was
an insult to you and was ostracized by all at San Diego
de Alcalá—that is what I was told when I first came. I
suffered—and you were kind. I saw you—and I knew
what love was. Can you conceive that love would
purify a man, <i>señorita</i>, make him over, make him regret
every mean and petty thing he had done in his life?”</p>

<p>“I—do not know.”</p>

<p>“We are in darkness here and you cannot see my
face, but, if you could, I’d not be afraid you could
read deceit there now. I’d gladly die a thousand deaths
to save you a moment’s pain. I’d die ten thousand if
I could feel your lips on mine an instant, know that your
heart was mine! I often have laughed at love, but now
I know its depth and sacredness. <i>Dios!</i> If there was
but the slightest hope——”</p>

<p>Her hand tightened on his arm; her voice was the
ghost of a whisper when she answered:</p>

<p>“How do you know there is not?”</p>

<p>“You play with me!” he said.</p>

<p>“And why should I, caballero? Since you met me
you have given me no affront. Twice you have saved
me——”</p>

<p>“It is gratitude makes you speak!”</p>

<p>“It is not gratitude, caballero. And, whatever it is,
I have fought against it in vain.”</p>

<p>“It is pity!”</p>

<p>“It is—is love,” she said.</p>

<p>“For me?”</p>

<p>“For you, caballero. I hated your name before you
came to San Diego de Alcalá. I hated you when you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
arrived. I tried to keep on hating you, and could not.
Ah, have pity and be kind to me! Father, mother,
friends—all are gone. There remains but you. Have
pity—and be kind.”</p>

<p>“You need not offer me love to gain my protection,
<i>señorita</i>. You have that always.”</p>

<p>“Can you not understand? I loved you even before
you rescued me this day. When we were coming from
the rancho I would have been glad had you covered my
face with kisses. That is immodest, perhaps, but I care
not. It seems that love only counts now.”</p>

<p>“But if I am Captain Fly-by-Night, a rogue and
outcast——”</p>

<p>“I love you!”</p>

<p>“Spurned by loyal men and traitors alike——?”</p>

<p>“I love you!”</p>

<p>“The man who boasted he would win you,
<i>señorita</i>——?”</p>

<p>“You have made good your boast—you have won—still
I love you!” she cried.</p>

<p>“<i>Dios!</i> The saints are good at last! Ah, loved one,
could I but see your face now!”</p>

<p>“There would be no deceit in it, caballero. I love
you! Have pity, and be kind!”</p>

<p>“Kind! May the saints teach me new ways of kindness!
We must live—we must live now!”</p>

<p>He clasped her close, rained kisses on her face, felt
her own lips respond to his, knew that tears were
streaming down her cheeks. In the darkness that put
night to shame they plighted troth, while the shrieks
of hostiles came to their ears, and the cracking of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
flames, and the knowledge of violence and pain and
death was in their minds. Yet in their hearts was a
song such as love always causes, and a new courage to
face whatever was to come....</p>

<p>“To the chapel—it is the only chance,” he said, after
a time. “I pray the Governor arrives soon!”</p>

<p>“And then—?” she asked. There was sudden fear
in her heart for her caballero. Had not the Governor
ordered him taken alive or dead? Where was the way
out?</p>

<p>But he had no chance to answer. Behind them a
shaft of light struck into the tunnel; the shrieks came
nearer. The hostiles had found the opening at last.
Now they advanced swiftly, pistols ready, holding
torches above their heads, crying vengeance on the
caballero who had slain their leader.</p>

<p>With the girl still clasped in his arms, he stumbled
on through the tunnel, making better progress than his
pursuers since he had been through it so often before.
He stopped once to discharge his pistol and check them
for a moment, and then staggered on, bending low
where the tunnel was small, running at times, shielding
the <i>señorita</i> at the sharp turns.</p>

<p>He stopped. Far behind were the cries of their
pursuers; ahead was the din of battle. The caballero
peered through the crack into the mortuary chapel and
saw one wounded soldier there tying a bandage on his
arm. The door to the main part of the church was
almost closed.</p>

<p>He hesitated only long enough to whisper instructions
to the girl, then tugged at the section of wall so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
that it swung inward. With a bound he was in the
chapel, his empty pistol menacing the trooper. Anita
ran in behind him.</p>

<p>“Hold!” the caballero cried. “Not a move, <i>señor</i>,
else you die!”</p>

<p>Covering the soldier with the weapon, he went back
and swung the section of wall shut again. Then he
whirled and advanced toward the other man, drove him
ahead, hurried him through the door into the main body
of the church and dropped the heavy bar.</p>

<p>“The last stand,” he laughed, clasping the girl to
him again. “Foes behind; foes ahead; here we fight it
out, beloved!”</p>

<p>They could hear the wounded soldier screeching the
news to soldiers and frailes. Captain Fly-by-Night had
appeared from nowhere in the mortuary chapel;
Señorita Anita was with him! She was in the power of
Captain Fly-by-Night!</p>

<p>But the caballero paid scant attention to the wails of
the trooper he had startled. He was working frantically
to block the opening in the wall. Benches, railings,
adobe blocks, huge cubes of stone he tore from
their places and piled against the movable section of
masonry. The hostiles would have difficulty entering
that way!</p>

<p>They heard the Indians in the tunnel screeching their
anger at being thus blocked. Light from their torches
came through the crack. From the main part of the
church rolled the sound of volleys, the ringing of
blades, groans, screams. Someone was pounding on
the door of the mortuary chapel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span></p>

<p>Anita Fernandez stood against the wall, breathing
quickly, a whimsical smile on her lips, something of
timidity in her manner now, and watched the man to
whom she had given her kisses. For, despite danger
and noise of battle, the caballero sat on a block of stone
and loaded his pistol again—and as he loaded it he
smiled and hummed a song.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"><span class="tall-2">CHAPTER XXIV<br></span>

<span class="s8">LOVE PROVES TRUE</span></h2>

<p>The hammering at the door of the mortuary
chapel ceased after a time, for those in the
main part of the church had more serious
business to occupy their attention than the attempted
capture of Captain Fly-by-Night.</p>

<p>The front doors of the church had been battered in,
and several times hostiles had invaded the building, but
always to be driven back after suffering heavy losses,
for men can fight with thrice their usual strength and
courage when making a last stand against an overwhelming
foe.</p>

<p>Now storehouse and hospital building and guest
house were burning, the most of the loot having been
removed, and clouds of heavy smoke poured into the
church, half suffocating the defenders there, yet at the
same time proving a blessing, since the dense pall made
it impossible for those in the plaza to get good aim at
a defender.</p>

<p>In a corner Señora Vallejo, some wives of ranchers
and a few loyal Indian women and children crouched,
the most of the time at their prayers. Dead men were
against one wall, wounded against another, a fray
attending to the latter. At the windows and both sides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
of the doorway stern men waited with muskets and
pistols to fire whenever a hostile could be seen through
the smoke. Thanks to the action of the <i>comandante</i> in
removing supplies from the presidio, there was an
abundance of ammunition.</p>

<p>Yet the defenders were being cut down one at a time,
and it seemed only a question of hours until the enemy
would triumph. It was the sudden, unexpected rushes
those in the church feared, for if enough hostiles could
invade the church at one time the defenders would be
scattered and cut down.</p>

<p>“A ghost, eh?” Cassara was shouting in Gonzales’s
ear. “So this Captain Fly-by-Night is in the mortuary
chapel, eh? I told you I saw him go into the church.
He has been hiding there!”</p>

<p>“The imbecile trooper declares Señorita Anita is with
him, and how can that be?” Gonzales wanted to know.
“We are all aware that she was left behind in the guest
house, and that Rojerio Rocha went there to save her.
Since the guest house is in flames, it is to be supposed
both died there.”</p>

<p>“The trooper saw double,” Cassara replied. “He had
been wounded. But Captain Fly-by-Night is there,
nevertheless, and presently we shall attend to him.
Hah! When I stand before him——”</p>

<p>“If I do not face him first,” Gonzales interrupted.</p>

<p>“Bar the door, will he? ’Twill not take me long to
break it in when I am at liberty to do so. ’Ware the
window, good pirate! They are coming again!”</p>

<p>The hostiles had prepared for another rush, and now
they made it, plunging through the smoke and into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
church in an effort to exterminate their foes. A concentrated
fire met them, as it had several times before.
Some fell; others rushed on.</p>

<p>Here and there the combat was hand-to-hand. Every
foot of the way they found disputed by a determined
man. They were driven out again, leaving dead and
wounded behind them; and those inside placed another
man against the wall and bound up more wounds.</p>

<p>The smoke was stifling now. Women and children
hung around the big water jars, gasping for breath.
The faces of the men were grimy, their eyes red.
<i>Comandante</i> and ensign rushed from one part of the
church to another, alert for possible tricks of the enemy,
taking advantage where it was possible. Frailes were
building a barricade in a corner, preparing for the
forlorn hope.</p>

<p>The Indians in the plaza seemed to be quiet for a
moment, and then their shrieks were redoubled, and
another assault was launched. Hoarse voices of chiefs
shouted orders, a fusillade of shots tore through the
doorway, and for a moment no man could live at the
windows. Then came the rush!</p>

<p>More than one man felt that it was the last. The
ranks of the defenders had been cut down until a mere
handful remained. The frailes hurried women and
children behind the barricade in the corner, and the
soldiers retreated foot by foot, resisting stubbornly
but in vain. At close quarters shots were exchanged,
blades rang, fingers tore at throats.</p>

<p>“Back—back! The barricade!” the <i>comandante</i>
ordered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span></p>

<p>Back they fell, step by step, still resisting, carrying
wounded with them. Behind them the frailes and
women were loading muskets and pistols, for the
soldiers had no time to load now. One by one they
gained the shelter of the barricade, until all were behind
it, and then the hostiles faced a volley that drove them
raging back toward the doorway. But they were
inside the church—and the end was near.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the mortuary chapel the caballero had been listening
at the door, and when he turned to face the <i>señorita</i>
his face held an expression she never had seen in it
before.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“The hostiles are inside—they have driven the defenders
to a corner,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Then——?”</p>

<p>“Everything may end for us here. They will be
before us and behind us. Either they will enter, or else
fire the building. It is best to tell you the truth,
<i>señorita</i>; we are in a trap.”</p>

<p>“If—they enter—you will remember your promise?”</p>

<p>He held out his arms, and she slipped into them, and
for a moment their lips met. He was almost sobbing
when he answered.</p>

<p>“I’ll remember.”</p>

<p>“You’ll not let them take me alive?”</p>

<p>“Never that, <i>señorita</i>! I wish we might face a
different future. I am just beginning to find life worth
the living,” he said. “But at least I can die knowing
your heart is mine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span></p>

<p>Hostiles in the tunnel were still battering against the
wall, trying to gain entrance. The caballero had been
watching there carefully, yet found no cause for alarm.
One shot had come through the crack, but it was an
easy matter to stand in such part of the chapel that no
bullet could reach them.</p>

<p>He crept to the door again and listened, Anita close
behind him. The shots seemed to be scattering now,
and he sensed that the Indians were preparing for the
last rush. He heard the <i>comandante</i> shouting orders.
Children were crying; the voice of a fray in prayer
could be heard above the din.</p>

<p>Again the men in the tunnel assaulted the wall, and
the caballero left the door quickly to stand in the centre
of the room, pistol and sword ready in case an entrance
should be made. But the barricade he had constructed
against the section of masonry held despite the furious
attack upon it.</p>

<p>In the church there was another chorus of shrieks, a
volley, cries of pain and rage—for the final attack had
begun. The caballero clasped Anita in his arms again,
and so they waited for the end, the girl with her face
against his shoulder and fingers in ears to keep out
the death wails and frenzied cries.</p>

<p>The defenders were shouting now, in mock courage
the caballero thought, going down to their deaths fighting,
dying like men. Suddenly the battering at the
wall ceased, and cries from the tunnel told that the
Indians were retreating quickly. Word had been
passed to them, he supposed, that victory was in the
front, and they were eager to be in at the death. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
would watch the outlets of the tunnel, of course; there
could be no escape that way.</p>

<p>“It is the end, beloved,” the caballero breathed. “Our
love dies almost as soon as ’twas born. You do not
regret——?”</p>

<p>“I regret only that we cannot spend a life together,
my caballero,” she replied. “Ah, ’tis cruel!”</p>

<p>Again their lips touched, and then he half turned
from her, and motioned to the corner.</p>

<p>“Pray,” he whispered. “Pray there, beloved, with
your back to me. I could not do it if I looked into
your face. Pray until the end——”</p>

<p>Now she was white of face, and her lips were trembling,
but she only looked him once in the eyes and then
did as he said. Facing the wall, she knelt and prayed,
while the caballero looked to his pistol to see that it
was properly charged, and himself said a prayer under
his breath.</p>

<p>Six feet behind her he stood, his eyes upon the floor,
his ears strained to catch every sound from the church.
The defenders were putting up a stubborn resistance,
for the <i>comandante</i> was still screeching orders, and the
volleys crashed, and the hostiles shrieked their anger
at being held from their prey.</p>

<p>And then the tone of the shrieks changed from anger
to fear! The caballero stepped swiftly close to the
door. He heard the defenders cheering; heard heavy
volleying that was not inside the church; heard strong
voices raised in shouts and the sound of galloping hoofs,
the wailing cry of a fray.</p>

<p>“My God, I thank Thee!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span></p>

<p>Sergeant Cassara’s great voice was raised in a howl
of relief and encouragement. Running feet sounded
in the church. The caballero’s heart was pounding at
his ribs, and he was trying to beat from his brain the
sudden hope he felt for fear it would prove unfounded.</p>

<p>Another volley; another chorus of shrieks as from
a far distance; more cries of anger, and gladness, and
surprise! Then a strong voice that had not been heard
before:</p>

<p>“At those flames, some of you men! Help the
wounded here! Get the women and children out of
the smoke! Lieutenant, see that every hostile is run
down—we want not one to escape! If we had been
a minute later——”</p>

<p>Señorita Anita, busy with her prayers and her agony
of mind, had not noticed these things. And now the
caballero, with a glad cry, ran to her, lifted her bodily
from the floor, and covered her face with kisses.</p>

<p>“The Governor, beloved!” he cried. “His excellency
has come—in time! Oh, beloved—beloved!”</p>

<p>Once more the pounding on the door!</p>

<p>“Open, in the Governor’s name! We know you are
there, Captain Fly-by-Night! There is no escape!
Open!”</p>

<p>The caballero stood in the centre of the chapel with
Anita nestling against his breast, and he spoke in
whispers, giving no attention to the summons at the
door.</p>

<p>“You are safe now, beloved,” he said. “The world
has not come to an end, you see. It is pretty much as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
it was before this revolt. You can be again with your
friends, with people of your rank. Is life not good—after
all?”</p>

<p>“With you it is,” she whispered in reply.</p>

<p>“When all was dark you spoke of love to me,” he
went on. “There was nothing in the future for you
then. But now there is everything in the future. You
can face the world again——”</p>

<p>“Stained by a relative’s act, caballero?”</p>

<p>“Who knows of that? It is believed Rojerio Rocha
died a loyal man. You know differently, and your
<i>duenna</i>, and myself. None ever will open lips to speak
of it. None other ever will know, <i>señorita</i>. You can
hold up your pretty head as before, and live, and be
happy. At the rancho the months will dim the
memories of this thing. Think, <i>señorita</i>! You have no
need of me now.”</p>

<p>“No need of you?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Have you, <i>señorita</i>? Things are different now. No
longer do you need the worthless caballero like myself.
Could you hold up your head if ’twas known Captain
Fly-by-Night held your love?”</p>

<p>“I could,” she said, “and proudly!”</p>

<p>“If the man who boasted had won you——?”</p>

<p>“Still, I could!”</p>

<p>“Gambler, thief—renegade——?”</p>

<p>“The caballero who saved me, and whom I love—none
other! And no renegade!”</p>

<p>“Yet there were orders to take me, dead or alive.
Think you these dead and wounded men will change
the Governor’s mind? I swear I had no part in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</span>
revolt, <i>señorita</i>, but none will think so, except perhaps
your charitable self.”</p>

<p>They were pounding on the door again, but the
caballero gave no reply.</p>

<p>“I love you,” she said simply.</p>

<p>“You gave me word of your love while in deadly
peril, <i>señorita</i>, at a time when no other man could offer
you protection, perhaps through momentary gratitude
at what I had done. Now it is not necessary, <i>señorita</i>,
for you to stand by that word. You have but to go
through that door to be with your friends again—you
need not lower yourself longer by companionship with
Captain Fly-by-Night.”</p>

<p>“There is no one else,” she answered. “All are
gone. And were there a million, did to stand by you
mean to be ostracized by all the world, yet by your side
I’d stand. Anita Fernandez does not give love for
gratitude, <i>señor</i>. And she gives it but once!”</p>

<p>“My beloved!” he cried, holding her close.</p>

<p>Now the battering at the door would be denied no
longer, and the Governor’s voice came to them.</p>

<p>“Inside, there! Open, Fly-by-Night, for there is no
escape. If you have harmed the <i>señorita</i>——”</p>

<p>“I am here and safe,” the girl called.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven!” they heard the Governor exclaim.
“Open and surrender, Fly-by-Night! Surrender and
take the consequences of your act!”</p>

<p>The caballero looked down at the girl again.</p>

<p>“There is no other way,” he said. “There is no
escape——”</p>

<p>“N—no! Have you forgotten? Even if you can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span>
prove you had no part in the uprising, there is still
another charge. Did you not slay Rojerio Rocha? He
was the Governor’s friend. My word, the <i>señora’s</i>, that
he was the real renegade, would not be taken in the
absence of other proof. Think you the Governor would
believe ill of his dead friend? They’d have your
life——”</p>

<p>“There is no other way, beloved. One kiss—again—and
I must open the door!”</p>

<p>“No—no! I cannot lose you now!”</p>

<p>“It would be better for you to pretend no interest in
me,” he said. “Then my death as a felon will not
stain you.”</p>

<p>“I stand by you, caballero, in the fact of whatever
may occur; I tell my love to the world as soon as you
open that door; I fight to save you—use every
influence—and will be proud to let all know it! What
care I what the world says, caballero? I know the man
who holds my love—know him better than the world
that has maligned him——”</p>

<p>“Ah!” he cried, and covered her face with kisses
again. “This were love indeed!”</p>

<p>“Open the door, or we batter it down!” thundered
the Governor’s voice.</p>

<p>“I’ll open it presently!” the caballero cried.</p>

<p>In the other room there was quiet for a moment while
they awaited the caballero’s appearance. Before the
door were Gonzales, Cassara, Ensign Sanchez, the
lieutenant, all with swords drawn and held ready, all of
them wounded slightly, all fatigued, yet all eager to
cross blades with Captain Fly-by-Night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span></p>

<p>“Back!” the Governor was ordering them. “I want
this man alive, to make an example of him!”</p>

<p>Inside, the caballero took his arms from around the
girl, and stepped to the door. In the face of such a
predicament he still could smile and hum a song. But,
as he touched the bar, Anita grasped his arm.</p>

<p>“I go out first,” she said.</p>

<p>“No——”</p>

<p>“Ah, do not deny me! There is something I would
say——”</p>

<p>“As you please, <i>señorita</i>.”</p>

<p>“Kiss me again—again! Now—open the door!”</p>

<p>He took down the heavy bar and threw the door open.
Those outside beheld Señorita Anita Fernandez standing
before them, the caballero behind her. The girl’s
head was lifted proudly, and her eyes flashed as of old,
and she looked the Governor straight in the face as
she spoke:</p>

<p>“Before this man gives himself to you I want you
to know that I love him better than all the world——”</p>

<p>“Anita!” cried Señora Vallejo from one side.</p>

<p>“I want you to know that he denies being a leader of
the hostiles, and that I believe him. Twice he saved me
from dishonour and death. No affront has he offered.
It is true he killed Rojerio Rocha, and, as for that——”</p>

<p>She stopped; for suddenly the caballero had stepped
beside her, the whimsical smile playing about his face.</p>

<p>“Good day, your excellency!” he said, bowing low.</p>

<p>And his excellency, the Governor, bent forward, eyes
bulging, lower jaw sagging for a brief second, then
straightened and roared aloud:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span></p>

<p>“By the saints! Killed Rojerio Rocha, eh, girl?
Hah! By the saints, this man before us is Rojerio
Rocha, my good friend! Ah, boy, boy! They told me
you had been slain!”</p>

<p>Before them all he took the dishevelled caballero in
his arms!</p>

<span class="s8">THE SERGEANT SLEEPS AGAIN</span></h2>

<p>“Explain, rogue!” cried the Governor half an
hour later. They were in the plaza, where a
temporary camp had been established. The
fires were out, the smoke had drifted away. Wounded
had received attention, and preparations were being
made for burying the dead. In all directions troopers
pursued hostiles and cut them down.</p>

<p>His excellency had told how the revolt at San Luis
Rey de Francia and other missions had been quelled.
The body on the floor of the guest house had been
examined and word passed that here was the genuine
Fly-by-Night, renegade and conspirator, and that the
real Rojerio Rocha had slain him.</p>

<p>“Explain?” the caballero echoed. “’Tis a simple
matter. When I reached San Diego de Alcalá I was
mistaken for this Fly-by-Night. I thought to have
jest by assuming the rôle. Then the hostiles, taking me
for their leader through the same misunderstanding,
came to tell me their plans. Being a loyal man, I
maintained my rôle to learn all possible, and tried in
every way to delay the attack until the force from the
north could arrive.”</p>

<p>“Very good, my boy!” his excellency exclaimed.</p>

<p>“But they grew suspicious and soon I found myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
at outs with white men and red. Then came word for
Captain Fly-by-Night to be taken dead or alive at all
costs. To everyone here I was Fly-by-Night, of course.
The description sent——”</p>

<p>“A fool of a cleric copied your description from the
pass record by mistake,” cried the Governor. “I’ll send
him packing when I return!”</p>

<p>“It was at San Juan Capistrano that I first met discourtesy,”
the caballero went on. “They knew of this
Fly-by-Night’s insult to the <i>señorita</i>, assumed I was the
man come to win her, and gave me to understand how
they regarded me. Sorry trouble I faced by pretending
to be another man.</p>

<p>“Then the real Fly-by-Night came, and because
Rojerio Rocha was due, he was hailed as such. It
amused him, no doubt, to be called Rocha and introduced
to the <i>señorita</i>, placed in a position to win her.
Moreover, it gave him a chance to continue plotting in
security—for who would suspect Rojerio Rocha? You
understand? And I could say nothing then, being
known as Fly-by-Night. Oh, it was a pretty mess!
Things were happening with such rapidity that he was
not asked to show credentials, of course——”</p>

<p>“And you faced death,” said the Governor, “became
fugitive, allowed people to call you despicable in order
to be of service to the state? A worthy caballero!”</p>

<p>“That was not all the object,” the caballero replied,
laughing lightly and looking at Anita again. “I had
heard of Fly-by-Night’s boast, you see; and when they
took me for him I thought it would be a lark to
approach the <i>señorita</i> in that guise. I was coming to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
wed her at her father’s request, you see. We were as
good as wed, you might say, yet never had seen each
other. How much better—I am sure you will understand,
excellency—to win her true love under another
name, to be sure she was wedding the man, not the
distant relative her father had commanded her to wed.</p>

<p>“You see my point? And, if I could win her love as
Captain Fly-by-Night, the man she despised—if I could
turn her hatred and repugnance to affection, would I
not be sure it was real love?”</p>

<p>“Hah!” the Governor cried, and looked at the
blushing girl.</p>

<p>“It was done,” the caballero said. “And—thank the
saints, it has been proved the love is real!”</p>

<p>And then he crossed before them, and Anita, seeing
him coming, got upon her feet, and he took her into his
arms and kissed her there before them all.</p>

<p>A padre lifted hand in blessing; Señora Vallejo
smiled; the Governor nodded in approval; Gonzales,
good pirate, swore softly under his breath at this display
of young affection; and Sergeant Cassara slapped his
thigh and cried unto the sky.</p>

<p>“<i>Dios!</i> So I cannot slay him after all? He is a
friend of the Governor, eh? Not Fly-by-Night, but
Rojerio Rocha, a proper fellow! I shall go mad!
Better, I shall go to sleep for the saints know I need it!”</p>

<p>He threw himself on the ground against the wall;
and presently he snored.</p>

<p>And so the tale ends as it began, with Sergeant Carlos
Cassara.</p>
